Milos Atko is taken on a brief tour of Kolkata by the cab firms who can no longer ply their trade.Prasad Khatu slings our cab door open and beckons us to follow him. The narrow streets of Kolkata at this hour are a heaving mass of diesel fumes and noise. Prasad is indifferent to the leap of horns from the cars behind us; our taxi is now blocking the entire road. He is, however, impatient to your correspondent’s dawdling. Twisting us around by the shoulders he brings our attention to the greasy street sign that hangs on a crumbling wall on the corner of the street. Keeping with tradition, the signs are coloured in an Indian green (representing the lower band of the independent nation’s flag) and written in English (representing an old habit from its colonial past). The sign Prasad is pointing out reads: “শশী ভূষণ দা স্ট/Sashi Bhushan Dey Street”. Prasad’s English is poor so, once satisfied that the grubby street sign has been noted, he simply shoves your correspondent back into his cab.Inside the cab, he babbles, with what feels like condescension, while waving his phone around. He has several map applications open, he runs through Google Maps, StreetFinder, WayApp, CityNomad, Maiz. He shows the google profile for Sun Peace Takeaway and then turns our heads to see the same store out of the left passenger window. He pulls up the map to show that there is a chemist, a dentist and an ATM all bunched into one commercial plot — with another stiff wrench of your correspondents’ head, he makes sure that this composite is noted on the other side of the street. It’s clear, our location on the phone is accurate. The name of our street on the apps, however, is “বঙ্করাই স্ট্রিট/Bankarai Street”.To illustrate his point further, Prasad turns a narrow dog-leg turn two blocks over from the digitally-christened Bankarai Street. The traffic is heaving with cars and mopeds. The people of the area slalom between the narrow spaces between them, habitually indifferent to the lurches of the anxious vehicles. On this new street, Prasad is struggling to find the evidence he is so keen to show to us. He abandons us briefly in the taxi, instigating another eruption of car horns behind us — Prasad is speaking to a trader, who seems to lean away from him, and we feel that maybe Prasad is an aggressive man even to those who can understand what he is saying. Finally, he is pointed in the direction he needs and returns to the wheel, laughing and waving to the blaring horns. At the top of the street he pulls onto sidewalk, the old sign hangs over: “বঙ্করাই স্ট্রিট/Bankarai Street”. Prasad looks back at us and, winking slyly, points to the sky and revolves his finger around. As is custom with Prasad, he has made himself clear: It’s like this everywhere.Back at the taxi depot, the air is filled with lingering tobacco smoke. Our tour with Prasad was his last fare as a taxi driver in the city. Via an interpreter, he tells us he has been in the job 12 years. He is only 24 years old and our calculations on how old he must have been when he started driving in the city are met with an infuriated scowl for changing the subject. Fahad sits with us, he is the owner of the taxi service. In the last six months he has sold 20 of his fleet of 60 taxis; next week there will be 10 more taken for scrap; for the remaining 30, he is in negotiation. “It’s diabolical. We took on the market and won, and then the market says ‘yes, you won but now you need to make peace’, and they absolutely fucked us in peace.’”The demise of Kolkata’s taxi services began years before with the emergence of the on-demand taxi services. Fahad would still operate as a driver in his fleet in those days and admitted to making some missteps when the taxi apps first appeared. “Cities in India in the 21st Century are not like 21st century cities in Berlin, Paris and London. We already had illegal drivers trying to escort people. The police expected us (taxi drivers) to deal with it. But now these crooks have some silicon valley client manager emailing local government about their ‘drivers’, suddenly they are protected? Why?! Once they were not taxi drivers, now they are because they downloaded something on their phone?!”At the time the taxi unions in the city were strong, Kolkata is one of the world’s most congested cities, with numerous streets being labelled on the maps that are not passable by car for many hours of the day. The knowledge held by the taxi drivers was unique, and hard-earned — many start young (though legally none can drive a taxi until they are 18) and little-by-little would navigate the best routes through the city. At the emergence of the on-demand services there were protests from the drivers’ union, but what was most effective was the poor customer reactions. The freelance on-demand drivers would often get lost. Reliant on their smartphones for navigation around the city they would be directed into streets that the more wily taxi drivers would know were dead ends, or impassable at certain times of the day. Customers were late, and drivers would feel short-changed for the amount of time they had spent on one ride against the payment received (they cannot renegotiate the fare once accepted). The apps were being deleted rapidly, the taxi unions breathed a sigh of relief. “We knew they would not go away,” Fahad explains over his black coffee, “They failed at every hurdle. Exploiting their employees, paying huge sums for interest groups, paying off drivers to leave the union and represent them. They failed. They failed because they could not understand Kolkata. We had earned the right to exist without their interference, and what have they done? They have abducted Kolkata from us.”Around 18 months ago, drivers stationed at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport began facing difficulties with their passengers. New hotels have emerged from time to time, but abruptly the drivers were being confronted with hotel names that they were completely unfamiliar with, and on streets that they were sure had no such hotel. They began to get lost. Eventually these Kolkata natives would have to take their passenger’s phone and follow the address. They would arrive at hotels that they have known for years that were, in spite of the name on their passenger’s phone, was still called the same name it had always been. These occurrences became increasingly common. Unfamiliar hotel names and guest houses, positioned on unfamiliar streets, revealing themselves to be very familiar hotels on very familiar streets. When drivers engaged with hotel staff, they were finding confusion — no one had re-named the hotel to them. It was true, the problem was beyond the hotel itself. Nothing in the hotel’s physical reality had changed, only its online presence. What difference does it really make to a tourist what it says on the front of the hotel, as long as your phone tells you that you have reached your destination?On the wall of Fahad’s office is an ageing map of the city. Of course, they had stopped using it years ago when digital maps provided more precision. But the map on the wall does give Fahad an opportunity to show how the streets have all been changed. He runs his fingers against the paper, in conjunction with the touchscreen of his tablet, not a single street has the same name “We no longer know where we live. Yet, we don’t care. Of all the places, we should be the most sensitive to such imperialism.”There is no known reason for the renaming of the streets. Google as an American company cannot be held legally responsible for the changes, and the government has remained silent on the matter. Ultimately, the taxi drivers have been hurt and the pain is isolated to them. Most citizens use the digital map service to navigate around the city, and for those who live in a local area, the new names are not registered, since they are already orientated to the area; or they soon adopt the alteration. When the taxi drivers took to the streets to protest this faceless re-design of their city, they were met with an unsympathetic response from government. “A fringe group complaining that they no longer have dominion over our pockets.” claimed Ras Mukherjee, transport minister for West Bengal. The public opinion was more tepid; the taxi had primarily been a mode of transportation reserved for tourists and the wealthy. The general feeling from the streets were that their battle was with their customers, and not a fight that needed national attention. Fahad shakes his head and extinguishes his cigarette, “We do not claim to be holy men, we are rogues and will over-charge. But does the whole world resent a poor man taking a few extra sheckles for his work, that they’ll permit the powerful to completely re-define the ground we walk upon?”Prasad is packing his things and relocating his family out to the steel mills in Durgapur, he has a job lined up from another former driver who abandoned the taxi-life 6 months prior. Fahad laments that the people of Kolkata could not see that their dispute was wider than the drivers’ protecting their profits. He sees the re-designs as more than an attempt to undermine a powerful working class community, “I don’t believe they care for us (taxi drivers) this much — whoever they are!”, he mutters with some irony, “It is about undermining any form of civil action. India freed itself with the gathering of people and marching against exploitation and tyranny. Now, if the world puts us in a position where we must gather again, how are we to find the location?”Once finished with the interview, your correspondent himself hails a cab via an app and its clear how little we need to question these things. My phone has the location of the hotel, whatever the name of the street it puts on the screen is immaterial. The same goes for the driver, the location is given to him and the screen guides him through the city. We’re both passengers. When life has been boiled down to getting from A to B, what does calling anything other than A and B matter? However, when we consider what could be the limit of this conflict, there is something disconcerting about the taxi drivers’ defeat. If technology is able to effectively render a whole base of knowledge irrelevant simply by re-ordering the non-virtual world in the virtual, there will be more left behind than we are considering.Milos Atko is a part-time contributor to the HAP.

What are you willing to struggle for?,"Lucas DowdFollowMicrosoft Cybersecurity--ListenShareI recently posted a question to my LinkedIn network, asking:What is the biggest blocker to achieving digital transformation?Consistent answers included “mindset”, “complacency”, “culture”, “technical challenges”, “debt”, and “apathy”.One unexpected answer stood out to me…“current success.”If your business is growing, why introduce change and increase costs that could derail a perfectly good situation?The obvious reason to embrace change is that it’s an investment in the future of the business. Companies trying to compete in a globalized economy must keep up or they run the risk of becoming extinct. Still, some leaders struggle to justify the costs of change or reconcile the uncertainty of the investment.One thing I say a lot is that digital transformation is not a project, strategy, or initiative we choose to engage in — transformation is something we all are going through, whether we like it or not. The digitalization of our lives is our reality in 2019, where we can’t fathom how we operated before smartphones, social media, mobile banking, and delivery on demand.There is a risk to investing in the future, but there is also a risk standing still — which risk would you rather take?----Microsoft CybersecurityAs an Enterprise Security Executive at Microsoft I work with business leaders on the security components of digital transformation.

2,1753,https://medium.com/@rohela99/microservice-canvas-ae0c95cc9c2b?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,Microservice Canvas,None,"RohelaFollow--ListenShareEvery business analyst who has worked or works in digital projects has come across the term “microservices”. More and more businesses are implementing this way of working in their organization.The need for the business analyst to understand this way of working has increased. One of the best ways to get your head around this architectural style ways of working is to get involved in designing the microservice with the development team. Before you can start designing the microservice you need to understand both the ‘surface of the service’ and ‘below the surface’ element of the service.At the beginning microservices architectural style was pushed by developers and technical architects, who were keen to deliver faster software to the end users. However, by taking this approach it has resulted in developers who want to start coding straight without thinking about the design of their service or the wider architecture of the organization.This is where the business analyst comes in- we are there to make sure that the microservice has been designed in a way that meets both the business and user needs. Nevertheless, there is a desire to avoid using a tool that can hinder the development team and therefore reduce the benefit of utilizing microservice architecture.If you have worked in an Agile environment you will be familiar with the concept of canvas- product canvas, UX Lean canvas and so forth. Simon Brown (http://simonbrown.je) has taken the concept of Lean UX canvas and has applied it to Microservice architecture.One of the things that I love about using canvas in Agile projects is the structure that they bring to the team and this is a perfect tool for designing the microservices in your team.The canvas above is the one that Simon Brown originally designed and labelled as ‘Microservice Canvas’ . Like with any Lean/design/Agile canvas there is a logical flow that you have to follow in order to make sure that you are getting best out of the tool.We have listed below the order you should follow, key question/s to ask the team and what is the aim behind each of the box within the canvas. You will notice that we have slightly tweaked some of the titles within the canvas.Key question: What is the name of the service that your designingAll of the team should be clear in what the service is being called, by having confusion over the name of the service can cause issues further down the line.What: At a high level describe the service- keep this user focusAgain, everyone in the development should be clear at the high level what the service is. If the team is unclear use a tool like Epic Value statement to get them the team back on track.Key question: what are the key tasks that the user needs to undertakes that the service enablesBy being able to articulate what tasks the users need to carry out helps the team to focus on what the design of the service should look like.Key question: which Queries under the microservice will be called — these should be linked to the user tasks.Key question: which Commands under the microservice will be called — these should be linked to the user tasks.Key question: which Event Subscriptions under the microservice will be called — these should be linked to the user tasks.Key question: which Event Publications under the microservice will be called — these should be linked to the user tasks.All the interactions that the user is anticipated to have with the service should be listed in the interface section of the canvas. By having all the interactions listed, it will help the development team to shape the underlying service implementation. You should not have any interactions that are not displayed on the canvas- if you do then the design of the canvas will be impacted.What: This is where you should document your non-functional requirements- performance, availability, security.This box may cause a debate between the development team and the product owner should be part of this conversation. By agreeing this the team will be able to decide the best approach for designing and implementing the microservice.Key question: what are the business rules behind the service For the canvas, you don’t need to go into too much detail- you should provide enough details to allow the team to think about they want to implement the service.Key question: what data is required for this service to operate For the canvas, you don’t need to go into too much detail- you should provide enough details to allow the team to think about they want to implement the serviceKey question: what are the names of the external services, that this microservice depends onThis is a really important box for team, so make sure that you don’t skim over thisWhile, I like Simon’s canvas and have used it in many workshops, I prefer James Higginbotham version. This canvas, seen below is nicer to work with and I feel the order of the canvas is better suited to the teams that I have worked with.You are not expected to know everything that goes into this canvas — that’s the job of the developers, tech architects, solution architects and tech leads.As, business analysts we should feel comfortable being part of the conversation technical team with the technical team. I have found that the best way to do this is by facilitating a workshop/discussion — that way you get involved in the conversation but are not expected to know everything. This canvas should give the team enough information to start the implementation of microservice.The canvas will also allow you, the product owner and the development team to write stories that will cover what the team needs to do in order to implement the service.Before you start creating the canvas, I have listed some things that you will need to be aware of before you start — these are things I have learnt from my own mistakes:So, next time you get involved in a team that is going to implement a microservice, ask them for this canvas. If they don’t have one then facilitate workshop to make sure that everyone in the team knows what the design and architecture of the service will look like.If you have any feedback please let me know via twitter @rohelaraouf----Rohela--Rohela--Rohela--Rohela--Farhad MalikinFinTechExplained--2Love SharmainDev Genius--10Arslan AhmadinLevel Up Coding--7Dineshchandgr - A Top writer in TechnologyinJavarevisited--2Shawn ShiinGeek Culture--3The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Rohela,https://medium.com/,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kTMTZQ4EqYekvE9_RfnOzg.jpeg",6,0

8,38643,https://medium.com/@KeenHome/smart-zoning-for-the-kids-1bacd3bb14a4?source=tag_archive---------110-----------------------,Smart Zoning: For the Kids!,None,"Keen HomeFollow--1ListenShareby Keen Home onLast week, we heard from five customers in five states about their experience with smart zoning from Keen Home and Ecovent. From saving money on their energy bill to elevating comfort, we heard about how homeowners and renters are improving their HVAC performance.In speaking with hundreds of users over the last 5 years, there is one use-case that is consistently brought up as one of the key motivations for installing Smart Vents: caring for children. The story is quite often the same: one of the least comfortable rooms in the home is the baby’s room and we bought your smart zoning products to change that.Because of the persistence of temperature imbalances in homes, temps between rooms can vary dramatically. When raising a family, that can mean choosing between your comfort or your kids’ comfort, or worse, everyone tolerating some discomfort. Experts recommend maintaining baby’s room at between 68 and 72 degrees, with rooms that are too cold raising the risk of pneumonia, and those that are too hot, raising the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).Unless you have your thermostat installed in your child’s room, maintaining a precise temperature band for your child’s health and comfort is easier said than done. Even if a thermostat or remote temperature sensor (if you have a smart thermostat) is installed in the room, without a way of controlling airflow throughout the home, dynamic changes to the temperature in that room are only possible by raising or dropping the temperature in other rooms, further exacerbating imbalances throughout the home.Where targeted room-by-room climate control for homes with central HVAC was virtually impossible before smart zoning, today, parents can intelligently control airflow throughout their home automatically or right from their smartphone.“By equalizing the temperatures throughout the house, these Smart Vents help keep my kids comfortable without freezing out me and my wife.” Tim, IllinoisTim was an early adopter of our technology who wanted Smart Vents for his home specifically so he would have more control of his family’s comfort in their home. Like most Americans with central air, he struggled to find a viable solution to rooms that were imbalanced. He installed a Smart Thermostat, which helped him manage his HVAC system’s run time, but did little to balance the temperature throughout the home.With Smart Vents installed, Tim was able to target airflow to specific rooms at specific times. When his family was together in the living room, his Smart Vents would direct air from adjacent rooms to keep everyone comfortable. When everyone retired to their own rooms, his Smart Vents would redirect air to those newly occupied rooms. Where Tim and his wife had at one point needed to live with being uncomfortably hot or cold to keep their children comfortable, today they can intelligently distribute airflow where it is needed, keeping their home in balance without compromise.With smart zoning installed, homeowners can direct airflow to individual rooms, while limiting airflow to rooms that don’t need it. That means greater control over temperatures in the most critical rooms in your home. If you have children, their comfort is paramount and airflow to their rooms has an out-sized impact on the temperatures they will feel in those rooms. For young children, proper control of airflow can be essential not just for comfort, but also for good health.Whether installing just a few Keen Home Smart Vents to direct air away from specific rooms, or installing a whole home Ecovent System for precise airflow control throughout your entire home, the results are the same: you’ll have greater control of the conditioning and comfort of your home for you and your family.For those with very young children, smart zoning can be just as important as a baby monitor, giving you and your partner a way to keep the baby’s room at a healthy temperature. So when you and your partner are considering how to keep your family healthy and comfortable at home, smart zoning from Keen Home should be high on the list!Originally published at https://keenhome.io on August 13, 2019.----1Developing hardware and software that enhance the home’s core functions, so your home can start taking care of you.

The challenge posed by the introduction of cryptocurrencies and tokens has allowed for an expansion of investment opportunities for new groups of investors, as well as giving millions of unbanked people around the world an alternative means of finance.This realisation is slowly spreading among financial regulators, which are now exploring the ways that crypto technology can be integrated into the widerfinancial and regulatory market framework.In recent months, with the rise in the popularity of tokenised securities — a SEC-compliant class of digital assets, comparable to equities stocks — the theme of regulation is spreading across the crypto space.At the moment, although the EU does not present a unified framework regarding cryptocurrencies — regulations vary by state members — the European Central Bank has shown plenty of initiatives in exploring ways to regulate and manage cryptocurrencies.In the beginning of 2019 alone, two major European regulatory bodies, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have publicly called for better assessments of crypto technology and its impacts in order to develop appropriate regulations.In an official statement, the EBA said it is calling for regulations to protect investors above all, and has asked the European Commission for a comprehensive analysis to assess whether unified crypto rules are needed across the region. In addition, the ESMA’s recommendations advise the EU Commission on the current regulations which can be suitably applied to crypto assets.In the emerging markets scene, where the positive effects of cryptocurrencies are more tangible, calls for regulation have also risen, with movements urging authorities to work on implementing and regulating cryptocurrencies.In India, where the legalisation of digital currencies has become a divisive topic, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has put a ban on banks and any regulated financial institutions from “dealing with or settling virtual currencies”. The move in April 2018 sparked backlash from crypto enthusiasts, who defend their right to enjoy alternative finance means.The CEO of India-based Cryptocurrency Exchange WazirX, Nischal Shetty, kicked off a social media campaign to attract the attention of Indian financial regulators over the need for ‘positive regulation’ ofcryptocurrencies, which provide the Indian population with an innovative, necessary and accessible tool for economic growth: “Please bring positive regulations in crypto and over 5 million crypto Indians will be thankful to you. Youth of India have found a new way to make wealth & this is especially important when there are not enough jobs for everyone,” he said.Crypto experts have already stated that 2019 should be “the year of crypto regulation” and represents an important move towards allowing the blockchain revolution to truly thrive and improve financial practices around the world.“Regulations are a necessary step to take the crypto industry to the next level. We have seen numerous cases of fraud and scams in the ICO space in the last couple of years, which has put off institutional investors and created a sense of distrust in crypto projects. However, with a regulatory framework in place, cryptocurrencies and tokens are no longer products of mere speculation. They have become real assets. It benefits both the investor side and companies themselves, and shows the maturity of the crypto market,” says Stefania Barbaglio, Director at Cassiopeia Services, leading crypto & blockchain PR.Keep an eye out for upcoming interview with Nischal Shetty about the crypto scene in India and the impact of cryptocurrencies on emerging markets.

With these evolutions, it’s almost becoming more and more important for large brands to start thinking a little bit more about how voice can play a role in how communication can be consistent with customers outside their phones or PCs, and a VUI designer might just be one of the most important roles to hire to get the job done in 2019 and beyond.Let’s start by breaking down what exactly “VUI” is. VUI is simply, the idea of a “Voice User Interface”, or rather, the experience and the contexts that a user will interact with vocally in order to reach their goals with voice devices of the future.VUI also expands to the idea of Multi-modal, which is the idea of voice-assisted screens and visual interactions. With all the settings that voice is appearing in and all the challenges of working with new metrics and a different level of interactions, it almost seems natural that a design role of it’s own can appear as well.So, let’s dig into the concept of the role itself. To clarify, a VUI Designer is a Voice User Interface Designer, who takes on the role of understanding and focusing more on scripting to create voice experiences which balance involvement in a conversation between something like an Alexa Skill and the user. The role also takes a sufficient amount of understanding around the limitations and opportunities a certain voice channel can apply, as Alexa and Google Assistant do have different ways their interfaces can be utilized with different design/script standards.A VUI Designer is tasked with more than just considering what a bot will say. They could be design leaders on a team as much as a mobile/web designer can be when it comes to understanding how things like multi-modal and inter-channel interactions if a voice skill allows the user to change their context and work through more complex flows.In the future, the role could take on even more meaning, with the introduction of Amazon Alexa for Business, as a way to help internal teams communicate/move information faster and more efficiently through voice.With the evolution and importance of voice assistance and voice experiences in the world of retail and consumer-facing enterprise, the rise of the VUI Designer is something that is coming with the rise of brand new “Voice Assistant” design teams which are becoming more prevalent throughout major brands globally.With this next evolution of design teams, it’s good to start thinking about what that would look like and how a VUI designer could potentially blend in between a Voice Assistant team and the core design team. As voice skills continue to grow and evolve with consumer trends, it’s useful to keep VUI design as something that could potentially be higher on the priority list to ensure that you’re not just settling for creating good skills, but creating *amazing* skills.----botmockEffortlessly design your Facebook Chat bots. #Facebook #Messenger #ChatBotsbotmockinbotmock--Obaid Ahmedinbotmock--botmockinbotmock--botmockinbotmock--Christina SainUX Planet--64The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Vikalp KaushikinUX Planet--35Michal Malewicz--24Unbecoming--768HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",botmock,https://medium.com/@botmock,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2DThVpwgrV0vqsO16SDdAg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*dLBKYOQopSXCPvVmlhNkFA.png",3,0

They can also help in diagnosing and treating medical problems. They may also detect temperature to the nanoscale.Why are Nanosensors important?Nanosensors may be the best mechanisms for exploring the internal mechanics and workings of living things. Nanosensors have the capabilities of identifying and treating injuries and disease.They are incredibly small devices and are extremely accurate. Nanosensors also don’t need a lot of storage of energy. They are also extremely small making them easily portable. For example, the average Nanosensor is 10–100 nanometers wide. To put this into perspective, a human hair is 80,000–100,000 nanometers wide. They also have the capability to detect multiple pieces of information at one time giving it the power to multitask. Nanosensors may very well be the final frontier of the scientific exploration of the human body.How do Nanosensors work?Nanosensors function by placing inputs into a “black box.” Nanosensor function is based upon inputs and outputs. Each nanosensor looks for a parameter and when it finds a satisfying input, or analyte, it is put into the “black box.” The sensor constantly records information and recognizes the analyte. Once the sensor had made contact with the analyte, the resistance of the nanomaterial varies, and therefore the way the resistance differentiates is what the input becomes while the output is made into an electrical signal that represents what the sensor has read. These electrochemical reactions provide valuable information and recordings for data collection.How are Nanosensors built?Nanosensors are built through a process called nanofabrication. There are many types of nanofabrication.Three types are:Focused electron/ion beam lithography: Electron/Ion beams are used to etch the surface of the nanoparticle to give it its unique structure and characteristics.Molecular self assembly: The fabrication of nanoparticles from thermodynamic interactions of molecules through chemical reactions.Photolithography: This is the most frequent technique used in all of the microfabrication processes. This process entails the exposure of areas of the nanoparticle to an ultraviolet light to initiate nanoparticle activity and function.A Nanosensor is built from four key components.The four components are:What are problems with nanofabrication?Since nanofabrication is a relatively new process, it is based largely on trial and error. Thankfully though, scientists have taken the difficult job of creating many more models and simulations of nanosensors in order to increase the accuracy and decrease the flaws of the nanosensors. Another difficulty with the process of nanofabrication is that since the nanosensors are so small, the construction of nanosensors must be accurate and easily reproducible. Another difficulty with the process of nanofabrication is the strict laboratory conditions required in order to have precise manufacturing without error. For example, one small temperature change in the construction of nanosensors could cause a flaw in the function of nanosensors.Citations:----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ben Garber,https://medium.com/@benjamingarber18,"5, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*hrA_wJaixTiXPRps.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*zKbz3pCElwEJFY4g.png",4,3

17,27704,https://medium.com/@risaac/smaller-ballparks-bigger-opportunities-dca36daaffb1?source=tag_archive---------25-----------------------,"Smaller Ballparks, Bigger Opportunities",Navigating an era in which technology tops turnstiles,"Ryan IsaacFollow--ListenShareFive years ago, when I was working for the Arizona Diamondbacks, a colleague from our business operations team remarked that future Major League Baseball stadiums would be designed with a capacity of only 20,000–25,000 seats. His reasoning was straightforward and logical: the at-home experience was too enjoyable for fans to pass up. Flat-screen TVs had become ubiquitous, and broadcasting capabilities presented viewers with higher definition as well as more angles and insights than ever before. Not to mention, living rooms typically have no obstructed views, no rowdy fans, no lines for concessions or restrooms and, perhaps most importantly, no $10 beers.The game has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by technological advances that created more accurate ways to capture new data. Interactive marketing and ad tech have benefited similarly from the granularity of new information. The impetus for a smaller stadium might have changed, but the support for it should be stronger than ever.Last year, each team received a payout in excess of $50 million after the Walt Disney Company agreed to purchase BAMTech, the streaming division spinoff of MLBAM (Major League Baseball Advanced Media). Following that acquisition, MLB later named MGM Resorts International its official gaming partner. In turn, MGM gained exclusive access to MLB-generated data, empowering all gaming initiatives that MGM wishes to undertake. MLB and its teams, through sponsorships and a variety of interactive platforms, figure to gain new revenues and tremendous brand exposure via its recently formed partnership with MGM.The Commissioner’s Office was quick to act in the wake of sports gambling’s legalization outside of the state of Nevada — and with good reason. One study from Nielsen Sports projects that the league will gain $1.1 billion annually in related revenue, with about 86% of those revenues coming indirectly as a result of increased fan engagement. Remember when “fan engagement” involved autographs and foam fingers?With the game flush with new money from new sources, limiting the capacity of a couple venues shouldn’t cause the pain that it once may have. The game has found new paths to financial success, ones much more robust than trips through the turnstile. Attendance is down for a second consecutive season, but with multi-billion dollar media deals in place, why worry? How many people accurately predicted or even anticipated the recent windfalls 10 years ago?Being receptive to change and creating adaptable infrastructures is more important than being able to identify each specific driver of change.In traditional advertising, campaigns are measured by impressions, or the amount of people who see a specific advertisement. In the interactive space, there are a plethora of more telling KPIs to measure a campaign’s success that take into account levels of engagement as well as various strategies for follow-up and further interaction.Perhaps paid attendance is less relevant than ever; targeted connections — both for the teams and for advertisers around the stadium — are more significant. As technology enables advertisers to connect with targeted demographics more accurately, a more interactive ballpark will provide value that a traditional stadium with generally fixed ads cannot.Marketers can report that the 42,324 in attendance at Citizens Bank Park on Sunday saw the Toyota ad at the base of the center field wall and the W.B. Mason sign in left field. But what else can either of those advertisers learn about their impressions? The younger generation of fans has grown up online with everything on demand. The pastoral images of the National Pastime paint an incongruous backdrop to the constantly evolving digital age. A ballpark with fewer seats could be the bridge.Reduction by half would naturally create greater demand for each ticket, drive up the value of each seat and largely ensure that every seat in the house is a great one. Those basic principles are timeless. Perhaps there’s even a way to create a safer fan experience and prevent incidents such as this recent one.It’s likely that neither MLB nor the players will initially embrace a plan to reduce and limit its annual attendance. Perhaps some may view the move as an admission that the game is stagnating; others may believe a lower-capacity stadium is proactively inhibiting growth. I, however, think it could be a way to engage fans in more dynamic ways and capitalize on additional revenue streams. After MLB proactively embraced legalized sports gambling, there’s an argument to be made for the ballpark as sportsbook.But before delving into the possibilities of a smaller-capacity venue, is there an example more illustrative of the need for shrink a stadium than that of the Miami Marlins’ current ballpark? In 2012, the doors to the 37,442-seat capacity Marlins Park opened. In its inaugural year, the total paid attendance topped 2.2 million, a figure that was 18th in MLB. Since then, the Marlins have been dead-last in annual attendance, cratering last year with an embarrassing 811,104 total (barely 10,000/game). During the 2003 World Series championship season of the Marlins, the team’s attendance total (in Pro Player Stadium) was better than only two other teams, the erstwhile Tampa Bay Devil Rays and — gulp — the Montreal Expos.If contraction is off the table and relocation is undesirable, then a stadium appropriately sized for smaller crowds must be considered.Capping annual attendance at two million won’t appeal to most teams. The franchise and executives behind the first “small stadium” would likely have to give up the dream of hosting an All-Star Game, would have to answer questions when its team qualifies for the playoffs and would be limited in its ability to leverage the marketability of October baseball. Or would it? Oakland and Tampa Bay have well documented stadium troubles and difficulties attracting fans to watch winning teams. There’s no reason one of them couldn’t become venue pioneers. Hmm… Oakland and Tampa Bay as forward-thinking trendsetters, where have we heard these stories before?MLBAM grew the value of the league and each franchise through significant technological advances and the ability to monetize them. All teams now embrace data-driven research and decision making. Las Vegas, the gambling capital of the country, has forever known how to leverage data and the house advantage. The numbers indicate that 40,000-seat stadiums are not working in Miami, Oakland and Tampa Bay. Oakland has proposed a 34,000-seat stadium that would be the smallest in MLB and mimic other new stadiums in its attempt to anchor a neighborhood. The stadiums and domes of the 1960s and 1970s gave way to parks and yards of the 1990s and 2000s. I expect the dimensions on the field to remain constant, but why shouldn’t the seating bowl be reimagined? As the game evolves, it’s worth focusing on stadium construction that lends itself to adaptability. Will a stadium be compatible as technological growth requires it to be?The Golden 1 Center, home to the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, sets the industry standard for technological innovation in the four major sports. In addition to an emphasis on sustainability and customized fan experiences, a trial with Verizon’s 5G enabled fans to indulge in a real-time courtside experience through virtual reality. It may not be long before baseball fans can experience what it’s like to stand in the batter’s box through VR. But which stadiums will be able to support it?Perhaps certain ballparks won’t need more than 25,000 seats on most nights because plenty of other fans will be experiencing the game in the stadium sports books or in the VR rooms. Maybe the issue isn’t always the number of seats available but rather the intent behind every seat.----warningtrackpower.substack.com || former @padres @dbacksRyan Isaac--Ryan Isaac--1Ryan Isaac--Ryan Isaac--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ryan Isaac,https://medium.com/,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*MCnWWFIHV50OWovZfua7yA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Ab9kZ7YWeM-hEVTUmxuetw.jpeg",6,215

Instead of getting things done I spend more time on what I am going to use to get things done. Let me explain.I have always had an (unhealthy) obsession with all things tech. As I write I own a Chromebook, MacBook Air (2011), Windows 10 PC and a 9.7” iPad Pro as well as an ageing iPhone 5s.Up until recently I was quite happy with my Chromebook – it did everything I needed from a laptop but then the dreaded “i wonder if there is something better to use” set in. Now I have files, blogs etc dotted around in iCloud, One Drive and Google Drive. I never know what hardware to use and that ends up hurting my output.Choice is paralysing me. So how can shake this off?I have decided I need to to have a tech plan (based on limited funds sadly). This plan needs to incorporate a seamless experience across devices and definitely needs to incorporate Google Photos (the best in my opinion).So this is my dilemma (albeit hardly life threatening).Currently using the iPad to write this but the keyboard is cramped but the ability to split screen and multi task is brilliant and portability is terrific.The Chromebook “just works” except when it doesn’t such as using client required software downloaded! This was the catalyst for this paralysis. Although the keyboard is not the best it probably is the sensible option although Google Docs is limited compared to Word and even Apple’s Pages.The MacBook, although old and will not be allowed to upgrade to the latest OS – Mojave, has the best keyboard by far. To me though the OS is still the same as it was in 2008 when i bought my first Apple product – an iMac.Windows 10 PC is standard fair – HP pro book– nothing great and an awful screen. I still find Windows 10 file and cloud management confusing and clunky but Word is great.So how do I chose a path forward?Well this is where you, dear reader, comes in.What is your set up?

26,29969,https://medium.com/@brian.lakamp/tesla-arcade-and-automotive-oss-c0f6ef650783?source=tag_archive---------69-----------------------,Tesla Arcade and Automotive OS’s,None,"Brian LakampFollow--ListenShareIn a recent interview, Musk made reference to the possibility of an app store for Teslas. Tesla also recently announced Arcade, a new game hub and essentially a mini “app store” of classic games. With Arcade, Tesla already has the seeds of an App Store.Adding an App Store to Tesla OS and ultimately making it a platform for 3rd party developers is a pivotal move. Historically, major platforms like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Google generated incredible value, scale and defensive position (a moat) by leveraging a network of 3rd party developers to build for the platform. It’ll be fascinating to see how such dynamics play out in the emerging arena of automotive OS’s.Implications of Automotive Platforms are MassiveThere are large implications if we frame automotive as a platform similar to PCs, smartphones and TVs. Duopolies tend to emerge for networked platforms. Those duopolies eventually drive the overwhelming value in those ecosystems. Microsoft & Apple for PCs. Apple & Android for smartphones. Roku and FireTV for TVs. (Yes, the last is still debatable.)What if network effects eventually take automotive in that direction too?The obvious response... “There’s no way GM, VW, or Toyota would ever cede their OS to a 3rd party.” That may be true. Nonetheless, Nokia, Motorola and RIM were all dominating leaders in smartphones with a similar stance before things headed toward iOS and Android. (Notably, neither Apple nor Google had an incumbent position in the industry.) And, while the future may not be written for TVs and Samsung, LG and Vizio, a trajectory is emerging around Roku and FireTV, also two non-incumbents.Network effects tend to seed quietly, take root without fanfare and then scale very fast. The hockey stick.If automotive bears out as other platforms have, the ramifications are massive. Some combo of an incumbent (GM, Toyota, VW, etc), Tesla, SiriusXM and Uber, could emerge as the dominant automotive OS’s over the next 5–10 years. If it turns out to be two non-incumbents, Tesla and Uber are decent bets.Cars Are UniqueThere’s a lot to unpack there, and the commentary is intended to be provocative. Yes, cars are certainly unique. Then again, so are PCs and smartphones and TVs. Though history may not repeat itself, it often rhymes.Turning from macro dynamics back to App Store mechanics, let’s call out a couple distinguishing aspects of automotive platforms:Let’s start with the obvious demarcation point between driving and non-driving scenarios. An App Store with exposure of “full attention” functionality like (gaming, productivity apps and beyond) is high value for non-driving scenarios. Tesla Arcade tees this up nicely.However, it is untenable to expose “full-attention functionality” to drivers. With a driver behind the wheel, functions such as audio, navigation and voice must be presented simply, within a unified framework geared to safety. While extensions to these functions could be executed as separate “Apps”, it is not the elegant solution. Rather, for audio and navigation, extensions should be handled via API integration into a tightly constrained experience, defined by the OS.API ExtensionAs long as drivers are a central consideration, expansion of audio, navigation and voice should be handled via API integrations into an OS-defined experience.Think Sonos. Sonos supports a myriad of audio providers, with consistent and controlled UI across all. Search works across services. Cross-service experiences (like playlisting) become possible. That’s a simple and powerful approach, and one that leaves control in the hands of the automotive OS with regard to safety / functionality tradeoffs.It is remarkable that Tesla hasn’t yet taken the Sonos approach for audio as a path to support new partner integrations. Though Tesla has a lot on their plate, the audio platform isn’t keeping pace with the rest of the car... SiriusXM is great, but TuneIn + Slacker don’t cut it as the digital service integrations (in the US). It is surprising that Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Apple Music, MLB and Stitcher aren’t yet natively and globally supported.Beyond audio, one can easily imagine a similar, Sonos-like approach to extensions in navigation and voice, also within tightly-defined limits. The map could expose API’s for select partners to layer in CVS stores, Spot Hero parking lots, MTA train stations, Dunkin Donuts locations, and Yelp restaurant listings, to name a few. The voice subsystem could expose APIs for partners like SoundHound, Spotify and The Weather Channel to add high value functions... “What song is this?” “Add this song to my Ski Trip playlist.“ “What is the weather going to be this afternoon?”Beyond such perceptible extensions, an automotive OS must consider how it builds the API toolkit for foundational functions around profiles and authentication. Such OS’s also need to think very carefully about how to extend the toolkit for wallet, notifications and targeted advertising capabilities. Automotive creates unique limits on what can and should be exposed.App StoreFor functionality outside driving scenarios, an App Store approach is the right approach. Tesla is clearly headed in that direction.Many bears will focus on Tesla Arcade as a niche move and Beach Buggy as a stunt. It isn’t. It tees up an App Store. It’s an important move and a big sign of future potential. Consider this… instead of Beach Buggy, if Tesla had announced a Hulu, Skype, Salesforce or Yelp app, might the perception and reaction of public markets have differed? Almost certainly.Looking beyond audio, navigation and voice extensions, it is incredible to imagine new services in gaming, video, communications, education and productivity that could add real value to an automotive platform in parked scenarios. Thinking about the possibilities is even more exciting when contemplating autonomous. Imagine watching movies, taking video conferences, reviewing documents and more while commuting. That’s a whole new world, one that takes the sting out of a commute.The Opportunity AheadAs a platform, Tesla is leagues ahead of competition. There are a great many bears that gleefully try to take Tesla down and sell a story around Tesla’s looming insolvency. While that may be true, if Model 3 numbers grow steadily in Q2 and Tesla relieves pressure on its cash position, Tesla’s opportunity on a worldwide scale is massive. It is teeing up defining functionality that could lock in its future dominance in the sector.Network effects could drive automotive toward a duopoly of operating systems, a scenario in which Tesla is a leading candidate for enormous expansion in market cap. Cathy Wood at ARK Invest is a big believer in Tesla’s potential for delivering outsized returns along those lines. It’d be great to see the future prove her thesis.References----Field notes from the front lines of the media and the Enernet. iHeartRadio, Totem and beyond.Brian Lakamp--Brian Lakamp--Brian Lakamp--Brian Lakamp--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Will LockettinPredict--19Kajal Gada--Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Avi Bar-ZeevinPredict--2HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Brian Lakamp,https://medium.com/@brian.lakamp,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jcYw2KVbzV8jlkLru8AMwA.jpeg",5,2

Ordinarily, I wouldn’t think twice about a critique of blockchain — there’s a new one every week — but this was different. The author is Bruce Schneier, author of “Applied Cryptography” and a veritable giant in the cryptography and security fields.Schneier is a writer and thinker I respect tremendously and follow diligently; his blog is informative, occasionally whimsically entertaining, and a great way to keep up with the latest in security and all the various ways in which you should be concerned about the current state of IoT. As a skilled technologist deep in the weeds of debates over the role of cryptography in public policy and trust in technology, I had hoped Schneier would take a more positive (at least cautiously optimistic) view of blockchains.Instead, his article, while being correct about many of the most vexing problems facing blockchain today, misses the point about the long-term significance of the technology. This response addresses the arguments Schneier makes, and the questions he raises. Views are my own.The core of Schneier’s essay revolves around two main points. One, that trust in humans and institutions is essential and can never be fully supplanted by trust in cryptographic systems and code. Two, that blockchain networks are plagued by many centralized points of failure — especially in the exchanges, wallets, and smart contract code through which we interact with them — and that the risk of these is often overlooked by supporters of the crypto ecosystem. I agree, in principle, with both of these points. It’s in the conclusion — “cryptocurrencies are useless” — that Schneier misses the mark. Let’s break it down.Single Points of FailureI’ll tackle the second point first. Although Schneier is absolutely correct to point out the problems with trusting single points of failure, this is, at its core, not really a critique of blockchain. QuadrigaCX failed because of poor human management of the business and lack of internal controls/contingency plans, not because blockchain technology is fundamentally flawed. Exchanges with better governance practices would never find themselves in a similar situation. Likewise, smart contract bugs like the DAO hack and the Parity multisignature wallet freeze were the result of human error, not fundamental flaws in the underlying blockchain protocol. In the DAO hack, the authors of the vulnerable smart contract initially failed to account for the possibility of a recursive send. In the Parity bug, the developers of the multisig wallet had, in the interest of reducing gas costs, switched to an approach in which all sub-instances of the wallet would be lightweight “stubs” referring to a library contract, but failed to properly secure the parent contract against a transfer of ownership.Importantly though, in both of these high-profile smart contract vulnerabilities, human coders had become aware of the mistakes in their initial live versions of the code, and intended to patch them — they just didn’t get around to it in time before they became public and were exploited/triggered. The vulnerability in Parity’s wallet was known and on their GitHub to-do list for months before the freeze happened. While painful, these learning experiences help serve as educational examples for developers — and we’ve recently seen some examples that demonstrate a more responsible approach to handling vulnerabilities in live protocols. Most notably, the Zcash team recently disclosed a counterfeiting vulnerability discovered in the Zcash core protocol. The vulnerability in Zcash was identified, categorized, studied, and discretely patched by a small team working with the utmost security and care, and as a result was never exploited prior to the patch and subsequent public disclosure.There has also been a lot of progress recently in the research community on auditing and automatically detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, even before they go live. Formal verification, while still labor-intensive and in its infancy when it comes to applications to cryptographic protocols, may help to further increase the security of new smart contract projects in development. Securely making critical modifications to live code that is handling millions if not billions of dollars in transaction throughput is incredibly stressful — Vitalik Buterin has likened it to making repairs to a rocket mid-flight — but it is entirely possible, and worth pursuing.It’s important to remember that points of access to complex technologies, even robust and well-established ones, will always be huge concentrations of risk, especially wherever humans get involved. These risks are mitigated over time for new technologies as we learn from our mistakes and improve security practices. The same is as true in existing internet applications as it is in crypto, and even in our banking system. Man-in-the-middle attacks and other breaches led to the development and promulgation of HTTPS on the internet. Password phishing has led to increased awareness of and support for two-factor authentication.Despite all these advances in security, exploitation of human flaws at single points of failure remains the easiest and most consistent way to breach various types of security systems in the existing internet ecosystem. Most people still use very insecure and easy-to-guess passwords and re-use them widely, and password guidelines haven’t caught up. And the most common form of 2FA (over SMS) has been fooled by a simple well-executed spoofed phone call to customer service in a “SIM swap” attack, letting a determined attacker gain control of your mobile phone number — and from there, often all of your other accounts that aren’t protected by a more secure form of 2FA or identity verification.These are all issues Schneier has written about previously. It’s puzzling to me that while he recognizes these issues do not condemn the concept of delivering banking services online or confidential information over email, he seems to use the same line of reasoning to conclude that blockchain technology is hopelessly vulnerable and therefore useless.The Trust GapOn to Schneier’s main point: “blockchain doesn’t eliminate the need to trust human institutions; there will always be a big gap that can’t be addressed by technology alone”, he writes, neatly summarizing his thesis. “People still need to be in charge, and there is always a need for governance outside the system.” This is made abundantly clear by the spate of recent issues in base-layer protocol governance in Bitcoin and Ethereum, which Schneier discusses in his article. I agree. Governance and the interaction between human groups of researchers and developers and the blockchain protocols they build and maintain remain fraught with issues that are far from solved. But again, it is not a foregone conclusion that blockchains are not good for anything as a result.Although there will always be a big gap between trust in technology and trust in human institutions, it is not the case, as Schneier seems to imply, that this gap cannot be reduced substantially and meaningfully, and the system of trust overall strengthened as a result. He asks at the end of the article: “does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way, or just shift it around?” His implication is that the answer to this question is almost always “no”, and most applications of blockchain today do not create a meaningful benefit from a change in the system of trust as a result of the use of a blockchain-based system.However, in certain applications, I would argue blockchain is capable of making some very meaningful changes to the trust system. The elimination of counterparty risk in financial products (particularly in collateralized debt and other asset-backed classes) can be hugely impactful — and we’ve seen some impact already. Take the example of MakerDAO — a decentralized platform for secured loans built on Ethereum that has issued tens of millions of USD-denominated loans since its inception in late 2017. By making the entire global community of MKR holders the lenders of last resort and maintaining a complex interwoven ecosystem of price feeds, watchdogs, and market makers, MakerDAO is able to provide secured loans (called Collateralized Debt Positions, or CDPs) denominated in a stable asset pegged to the US dollar (DAI) against a volatile asset (ETH) at interest rates unheard of in the world of centralized finance. The DAI stability fee is around 1% APR at time of this writing, though the interest rate has been as low as 0.5% APR in the past. Compare this with a typical LIBOR + 3% or more charged by banks for similar dollar loans against stock holdings — the delta in the cost of capital is substantial. Real people with ETH holdings have used this functionality of MakerDAO to refinance their home mortgages and take out loans to buy new cars, among other things. And in the near future, MakerDAO will be able to provide this lending functionality against a much broader range of tokenized assets on Ethereum.Of course, MakerDAO is not completely decentralized — there is still human trust involved. The product is reliant on a relatively small number of dedicated risk management teams, keepers, oracles, and market makers whose expertise and active participation is essential in setting risk parameters and liquidating underwater CDPs. The MKR holders (of whom there are relatively few compared with other crypto projects) have a responsibility to govern the system appropriately via voting. But total decentralization and elimination of human trust at all costs isn’t the point — at this stage in the system’s evolution, having too many MKR holders, too many keepers and market makers, would dilute responsibility and weaken the protocol overall.The genius of MakerDAO is that by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain as a shared source of trust in the risk status of loans, and as a way of distributing risk across a broad base and incentivizing all actors in the system to behave appropriately, the system is able to share risk more efficiently overall. In other words, the clever application of blockchain means that MakerDAO doesn’t lend like a bank — it lends like a central bank (h/t Steve McKeon). That, to me, is hugely significant.Code isn’t LawAnother pointed rhetorical question Schneier asks: “Does blockchain strengthen existing trust relationships, or try to go against them?” Often, yes — applications of blockchain technology do explicitly or implicitly try to go against existing trust structures, something that can probably be traced back to the original Bitcoin paper, if not earlier. Satoshi Nakamoto was fairly explicitly anti-bank, both in the original paper and in the other traces they left behind. “Code is law” is a maxim often repeated in various forms by ardent crypto supporters, usually as a refutation of governmental or corporate authority — even in cases where theft or other illegal actions occur.This was the reason for the ETC/ETH split following the DAO hack. When the Ethereum leadership team executed a hard fork to restore the stolen funds to their original owners, a minority group maintained that despite the illegal actions and significant damages caused to victims of the hack, those transactions should remain final and immutable. “Code is law” expresses an admirable spirit of techno-libertarianism, but the notion of code being the final arbiter of all things is a misguided one. It’s fair to critique this.But it doesn’t need to be this way, and, luckily, many in the community are beginning to come around to a more pragmatic view: that code is not law in and of itself, but blockchain can automate some aspects of law, finance, and privacy, and shrink (though not eliminate) the aforementioned gap between trust in technology and trust in human institutions. Many of the security token standards proposed recently include administrative functions for forced transfer or burn/reissue as a failsafe in case of illegal actions, loss of control of keys, or a token administrator going out of business.Adopting a shared source of trust, automation, and transparency (where appropriate) while fitting into and collaborating with existing systems and regulations can enable seamless automation of post-issuance servicing of financial instruments, replication of deal structures, and efficiencies in liquid trading and further uses of tokenized assets down the line that are simply not possible without the sharing of trust enabled by a secure public blockchain platform.We’re Just Getting StartedBlockchain technology is at a crossroads — in the throes of a ~90% correction in publicly traded cryptoasset prices, still struggling to cast off the scams and vaporware of yesteryear and “grow up”. But security practices are maturing. The smart teams — and there are many of them — continue to build and figure out creative ways to apply blockchain in a way that does meaningfully change the structure of the system of trust, without burning the world down in the process. I remain very optimistic about what the next few years will bring. Yes, there are issues to work through. But as we have with most transformative new technologies before blockchain, we will work through them, and the result will be worth the blood, sweat, and tears, and worth the wait. I hope Bruce Schneier will one day join us on the other side — we need thought leaders like him to help us build the future of finance.----1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Matt Lucas,https://medium.com/@MattBLucas,0,9,43
30,23482,https://medium.com/apex-network/apex-network-pre-mainnet-development-progress-update-6b3dca6a2a08?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,APEX Network — Pre Mainnet Development Progress Update,We are close!,"APEX TeamFollowAPEX Network--1ListenShareIn our last development progress update in February we announced the launch of phase two of the APEX Testnet. Since then we have been hunkered down in APEX HQ running tests and discussing optimization proposals and additional functionality to be included in the next release. As we are now fast approaching mainnet we would like to take some time to update you all on some of the technical changes and optimizations we have been working on during the last two months and leading up to the launch of our initial mainnet.As most of you have noticed, the first version of our block explorer was recently launched, and generally well received by the community. Upon its launch we mentioned that we were working on integrating the voting feature to elect block producers, and this work has now been completed. The web wallet we have integrated in the block explorer now supports voting and redemption of votes for block producers, and the transaction details for such voting will be accessable through the transaction details option. We have also been performing some upgrades of the explorer’s backend service, which is the cause for intermittent service disruptions recently. On the esthetic side of things, we finally found time to tone down the initial moony skin, making its appearance more sleek and professional.The APEX blockchain CLI tool enables the user to conduct transactions and issue a wide variety of commands for smart contracts. Detailed updated documentation for the CLI has now been uploaded to GitHub at the following address:https://github.com/APEX-Network/APEX-Blockchain-CLI/blob/dev/CLI%20commands.mdDuring the last two months we have been reauditing every single command of the CLI to ensure proper functionality. Another addition is the ability to convert the private key to a different format, regardless of the original format the user inputs.As an additional security option, we now also support offline signed transactions. Offline signed transactions are basically at a level of security comparable to a hardware wallet, ensuring that those who do not have or wish to purchase a hardware wallet will still have an option available to transact on the blockchain with maximum security. To properly understand this, it is important to touch on some technical aspects regarding offline signing of transactions.The basic procedure is as follows: Using the CLI in offline mode, the wallet owner enters the transfer address, amount to be transferred, gas limit and gas price to compute the transaction information using his or her private key. Doing this in an offline environment ensures the private key is not exposed in a networked environment to be picked up by malicious actors. The CLI will then broadcast the computed transaction information to be processed by the network nodes. We do realize that this may sound somewhat complicated to the average user, but rest assured it is simply an additional security measure available that is not intended to replace other functionality such as later hardware wallet support.One major change we have been working on is optimizing the characteristics of the dynamic expansion function of the blockchain, for which the most current version is found in the Proposal section of the CLI commands. To put it simply, this functionality allows for the block producers to change certain parameters of the block consensus to optimize the network without causing hard forks or having to manually update each node to the new state.The way we have designed the dynamic expansion governance is to arrange a weekly cyclic election process, where the nodes producing the top 21 number of blocks are elected to the governance committee of the blockchain. This means that to be able to propose changes to the block consensus, a candidate node will first have to be voted in (see the previous section on the voting feature), and then remain in production mode for long enough to come out as one of the top 21 producers for the current week. This election will take place every week in the early hours of Monday UTC time. It is our opinion that this design ensures that only block producers that have experience on the network are able to submit suggestions for optimization, instead of random nodes proposing changes that might not at all be beneficial for network functionality or stability.Examples of parameters that the governance committee members can propose changes to include such characteristics as lower gas limit for transactions, maximum block size and maximum size for individual smart contract. The latter limit is imposed to eliminate the risk of malicious large contracts causing stability issues on the blockchain.Once a proposal is submitted, the nodes comprising the governance committee will vote on the proposal and at which block height it will come into effect if approved. Approval requires a 2/3rd majority, otherwise the proposal will be rejected. Once a proposal has been approved by a 2/3rd majority of the committee member nodes, the proposal will automatically go into effect at the prearranged block height as each node will automatically record the approved proposal and its decided upon block height. This removes the need for cumbersome manual updating of the nodes and ensures smooth operation of the nodes and thus the blockchain.We are continuing to work on the dynamic expansion feature of the blockchain — it’s close to complete due to the addition of the features described in the previous section, but we still have some polishing we would like to do before the official launch.The past two months of testing after the launch of phase 2 of the testnet has brought significant stability improvements to the network. We found a bug in a voting contract which could have potentially caused the blockchain to stall due to the backend not being able to catch a certain exception — this issue has now been rectified and has been working smoothly since. No other major issues have been encountered.Another addition is that of a fast synchronization mode. This is a mode which is configured in a node before launch. It causes the node to periodically and proactively delete unnecessary transaction data and only save the latest status data of the blockchain, allowing the node to run using a smaller amount of resources. This is similar to a function found in the Ethereum blockchain.We fully expect the necessary work before mainnet can be launched to be completed in the upcoming weeks, keeping us nicely on track with a Q2 2019 launch of the intial version of our APEX Network mainnet. After that we will continue to work on stability and functionality upgrades, striving towards perfection — development efforts will never stop. Once this work has been completed, we will open the initial APEX Network mainnet to allow community nodes to join the network. When we open the network, we plan to select some supernodes to be able to participate in block production and testing of the network.We are looking very much forward to launching our initial mainnet, marking the completion of one of the most significant milestones of any project. During the development phase we have been studying other blockchains to assess the most important features and vulnerabilities, all the while comparing the solutions proposed by others to our goal of creating a blockchain tailor made for the needs of B2C enterprises. A mainnet is nothing without customers using it of course, and while we continue further development of the underlying tech with elements such as encapsulation of the blockchain services to create a «plug and play» solution for enterprises, we will also shift focus towards the actual integration of our target customers. Our gratitude goes out to all those who follow our efforts — we believe you will be as pleased as us to watch the evolution of the ecosystem in the months and years ahead!----1APEX NetworkBlockchain Powering the Next Generation of Consumer ApplicationsAPEX Team--APEX TeaminAPEX Network--1APEX TeaminAPEX Network--APEX Team--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",APEX Team,https://medium.com/@apexteam,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hbGGpCwtAQqpkL84qbt4tw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*lmoDyZAWsw3nP0fmIb7K0w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*IS6NQfHL1qIN7LENelT2BQ.png",6,450

Join the network at ","Dan SutchFollowCatalyst--ListenShare“If not us then who, if not now then when?”That question (or quote) has been attributed to so many people, it’s difficult to know quite who to reference. Was it Hillel the Elder, John F Kennedy, Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, George Romney, or perhaps, even, it was Emma Watson that framed such a powerful challenge? What is known is that many brilliant people have asked this question about the need for change and how it is going to happen. Many brilliant people have used it as a rallying call for action. And many brilliant people are asking it now to reimagine and rebuild a stronger civil society.A clear driver for the need to remake our sector is a recognition of the constant change around us. Some of which, as individuals, we’re striving for, much of which we seem to be swept up in. Social, economic, technological change — global shifts that seem to be driven by others: powerful businesses; big tech companies; foreign governments and people who don’t necessarily seem to have our best interests at heart.For decades, voluntary and charitable organisations have been the bodies focused on our social interests — especially those most vulnerable and in need. These organisations — set up ‘by guarantee’ to work to improve the lives of individuals, families and communities have championed the needs of those furthest from power, and provide support to those who need it most.But these organisations, largely, have not been able to respond to the pace and scale of change. As demand for their help has soared and their resources have shrunk, they rightly struggle to provide the guarantee they once did. The clarity of understanding of socio-technological change and the confidence to respond to new digital behaviours has meant that we are unable to provide support that meets the expectations of those in need, and are unable to critically advocate on behalf of those furthest from power: failing to hold new power to account.And as the pace of change shows no sign of abating, we desperately need trusted organisations that are suited to provide the stability, support and guarantee that meet the needs, behaviours and expectations of families and communities across the UK. The time is now.This need for change is already recognised across much of the charity sector and those involved in tech-for-good — and this question is being asked by so many people already. Whether that question has been asked by charities driving for better outcomes for their communities; asked by digital entrepreneurs desperate to use their skills and experience for social good; asked by those concerned about the implications of digital technologies on those most vulnerable in our communities, or asked by those desperate to use the power of digital, data and design to create a stronger, more just society. There’s a groundswell of people, organisations and communities who are not only ready, but who are already acting under that banner, taking responsibility to work towards a stronger social sector that responds to the changes in people’s needs, behaviours and expectations.So rather than ‘if not now?’, perhaps it is ‘what now?’. And the answer is a need to bring a social purpose to the digital revolution.The Catalyst shows that we now have the conditions for this change. Led at CEO level by The National Lottery Community Fund, Comic Relief, Esmée Fairbairn, City Bridge Trust, Paul Hamlyn Foundation and with the support of Ministers in the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Catalyst aims to support thousands of voluntary and charitable organisations to respond to the changing needs, behaviours and expectations of people, families and communities, using digital, design and data to achieve their charitable objectives and to create a thriving, stronger social sector. It builds on the work of hundreds of charities, digital partners and passionate individuals who are striving to bring about this better change, with a recognition that collectively we can create the change we want to see and the civil society sector that we need to see.And the who? Well that’s us.

This is his story.",None,"Ant GroupFollowAlipay and the World--ListenShareRecently, Ant Financial Chief Technology Officer Cheng Li (nickname Lusu) met with a group of interns at the company’s Hangzhou headquarters, where he spoke of his experience as Alipay’s very first trainee before it launched in 2004. These are excerpts of his comments.I was Alipay’s very first intern back in 2004. Given the current requirements of the company, I probably would not have made it in today.But back then, I was one of just four engineers put on a project to spin Alipay out into a third-party payments platform. Even though I was an intern, I was made chief architect of the project because of my previous experience with (e-commerce website) Taobao.com, and because of everyone’s trust in me.Our plan was to go “live” in May, before other competitors could enter the market. We promised Teacher Ma (Alibaba founder Jack Ma) that we would meet that deadline, but in mid-April, some colleagues raised the concern that the system had serious problems.My supervisor backed me up, and that made me feel really touched. But I was still uneasy. So I took another close look at the code and concluded that my colleagues were right to raise their concerns. As I reflected on the situation, I realised I had relied too much on unproven technology to use in so critical a system.I decided to pulled an all-nighter to try and devise a new system from scratch. The next morning, we gathered to discuss our next steps. Instead of blaming me for my error, everyone voiced support for the new architecture. We were all determined that the project should succeed.We successfully launched the new system in May, and that also marked the end of my internship. In July, I officially joined the company as an employee.Alipay’s early development was meteoric and the system had to continually improve to keep up with surging transaction volumes. We coded day and night. Then in 2007, we decided to entirely rebuild the system we had created just two years earlier, because it was the only way to support Alipay’s future growth.This total refactoring was one of the most famous projects in Alipay’s history. But we committed a big taboo by using the latest — hence unproven — technology. We wrote all of the middleware ourselves, which meant hundreds of millions of lines of data accumulated over the years had to be reformatted.As the launch date approached, we were still not confident that the system was ready. In the end, a decision was made to launch at the stroke of midnight on January 22, come what may.But when the appointed time came, we realised the system still couldn’t be launched because the accounts could not be balanced. This would be a disastrous error if the system went live. By the time we found the root cause of the problem, it was already almost 3 p.m. that afternoon.There were two unforeseen scenarios when we finally launched the new system. Firstly, because user and merchant demand had been suppressed for a whole day amid the upgrade, the pent-up orders overwhelmed the system. Second, the system kept displaying transaction errors.I remember continually rebooting and troubleshooting the system, and the whole time, there was a voice in my head repeating: “We’re doomed. We’re doomed.”But the system gradually stabilised as it worked through the backlog and fulfilled the merchant orders. The errors turned out to be false alarms and procedural in nature, rather than systemic.Looking back, I think we were really courageous. We made a lot of poor technical decisions on hindsight. But we pushed through no matter what, and because of that, we laid the foundations for Alipay’s development.The year 2009 brought us another major turning point with the launch of November 11 Singles’ Day (Alibaba’s annual online shopping festival). By 2010, in its second year, transaction volumes surged multiple times from the start of the festival at the stroke of midnight.No one dared rest that night, and by 8 a.m. in the morning, we knew it was going to be a rough day because our system was simply not designed to handle such volumes.So we put all of our computing resources where they were needed for payments, and disabled non-essential functions to free up our servers.After that challenge came another gigantic one: moving our technology architecture onto the cloud. This took almost three years of efforts, and by May 2013 we were fully on the cloud.At that moment, I felt this team had a very clear idea of our direction for the future: to build our very own platform and also build our own core database.No platform in the world has had to deal with the volumes that we do, and that is why we need to create our own technology solutions. And this technology is our dream, the dream that we will go “all in” to achieve.From 2009 to 2019, after much perseverance, we finally developed our own backend infrastructure capable of supporting all of our businesses, and that of many other companies.Ant Financial is what we are today, because of our trust in the young. We give them a very good stage, allowing each young person to grow and shape the future.And also because of our courage. Today Alipay still faces a lot of challenges, but as long as we band together, as long as we have courage, I believe we can conquer these challenges.I’m confident, because we have already created many miracles in this process. And I look forward to more courageous young people with dreams, to join us in shaping the future.For more news and information about Ant Financial and Alipay, check out our official website or follow us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.----Alipay and the WorldAnt Group is a tech company dedicated to bringing inclusive finance to the world, through Alipay and its global partners.Ant GroupinAlipay and the World--Ant GroupinAlipay and the World--Ant GroupinAlipay and the World--Ant GroupinAlipay and the World--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ant Group,https://medium.com/@antgroup,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*aFEbNxFtAvmvUhORK7Rm7w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*_FXDIGaAZHwuATiU0b_5EA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jvPMorCvYC8lIDMgubSnZg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*WFzU2Six1TXypGmU_i6DXw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*4ps0OMO7Hnzo5YTTTyBGwg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ONxWrRszoUoRt5JDMI48Jw.png",5,30

For the uninitiated, “hello world” in the nerdy world of coders is used as a sanity test in programming to check if a computer language is correctly installed, and is sometimes used to belittle developers who seem too female and pretty to deserve professional respect.But back to my “big entry”. I’ve been putting this off long enough, mostly because the blockchain space isn’t the most welcoming if you don’t have the tech merits that come with 10 years of computer science under your belt, or if you’re a woman (there are actually many unwelcoming spaces for women, but that’s for another post). I first came to hear of ‘the blockchain’ a couple of years ago, when I was at a digital marketing agency working in social media.One of my then latest clients turned out to be an ICO, which was then pithily described to me to be the crypto version of an IPO (it was about 2 meetings later that I was also warned to never put those two acronyms in the same sentence, but look who’s laughing now). Having had mere weeks to get the campaign ready, I had to throw myself into the world of $crypto (thank you, Twitterverse, for non-hash hashtags), bitcoin, Byzantine Generals, consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger. Put shortly, pain I wouldn’t have wished on my worst enemy (ok, maybe just that guy who stepped on my pinky toe in the metro this morning).For someone who had just resigned to her fate of “I thought I’d write novels but here I am, a marcomms professional writing/ transcreating copy for clients all day” — this was a hurdle I was less than happy to jump over. Selling things is hard. It requires a lot of thought, a lot of earnest empathy and even more research. The last thing I needed on my plate was to wrap my head around blockchain, the apparent fad that just would not die (why?!).Fast forward to 2019 and I’m now managing the marketing, communications and branding for Mangrovia Blockchain Solutions and its market division offshoots (Prosume, Brandzledger and TimeRepublik, to name a few). It’s been hectic, frenzied even. I guess apart from not knowing where and how to start, the reason why I’m only writing this first post now is also because I haven’t had the time to take a moment to collect my thoughts: thoughts I’ve had from sitting through or participating in speaker panels, blockchain fairs, meetings that have ranged from productive to… well, slightly less productive. But I won’t be vomiting them out today, mostly because they are too numerous to list comprehensibly. Every other day I find out I don’t know enough about something else. There are copious amounts of studying to do, not to mention lots of grappling — and I’m not just talking about concepts. I’m also thinking of all the people who dump techno-speak on you when you’re asking innocent questions about things they don’t know well enough themselves (what’s the record number of acronyms thrown at you in a single sentence? I count 6), so that you bugger off to that ignorant (albeit self-aware) hole you came from — “technobabble”, as Star Trek and my friend Colin LeMahieu have so acutely named.My point is — you don’t need to heap acronyms on anyone if you’re unsure of how to answer a question. In fact, you don’t even need to always to know the answer. It might sound intimidating to constantly discover new things you don’t know (fine, maybe sometimes it really is), but in truth, it is quite exciting. My non-sudden revelation of this whatness has taken its time to come, much like in this article, but that’s beside the point. The crux of the matter, when it comes to blockchain and technology and anything scarily incomprehensible that non-techies like myself need to remember, is this: be comfortable learning. Definitely don’t remain in your ignorance, but don’t beat yourself up for it either.As Marcel Proust aptly puts it, “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” It is in the marvel that comes with learning that one is reminded of his essence as a human being, and it is human that we must remain, in order to harness what technology can do for us. Did anyone need to understand how the Internet worked back in 1995 in order to use it? And yet, use it we did. Blockchain’s benefits (which you’ll find in plenty more articles we’ll be bringing to you via our publication, by the way) are myriad and numerous, but it would be a mistake to try to understand it or what it can do within the 10 minutes it takes to read a blockchain-explainer article on Medium. A technology’s potential is not in its definition, but in its use, and how we decide to apply what we know about it.So read up, young Padawan.I work for tech firm Mangrovia, a systems integrator and software house providing consulting, development and support services for blockchain-based solutions. Originally from Singapore, based in Milan for the past 7+ years now. I speak 6 languages (7 if you count “tech talk for non-techies”).Follow me on Twitter, or connect with me on LinkedIn.----the groveContemplating my big piece.

You can Google “Topic generator” and within minutes have an idea for a free write. We really do have it all. Someone ring the bell in Silicon Valley to tell everyone to pack up their AirPods and head home.Something tells me that even if there was someday an app for everything and there was quite literally no other way to “iterate” to discover a new idea, there would still be software engineers and product managers writing furiously on whiteboards, hoping to cash in on a sweet multimillion dollar deal in 2–4 years.I mean, that’s what happened to writing, right? No, of course not the money part. The exhaustion of original content. At some point, we had covered pretty much everything there was to write about such that we had to invent other genres and styles of writing to expand on ways to tackle the same things. Science fiction. Blogs. God forbid someone say tweets.I think that there is something inherent to telling a new story that invigorates budding writers and bright-eyed founders alike along their journeys. We’re all living with the private belief that perhaps we have something special to tell the world. That perhaps, in all of the noise of the digital age, we are worth listening to.We try everything we can to get our perspectives out there. Forget just writing. Millennials and Gen Z’ers are documenting their whole lives on social media. We’re trying to capture the precious moments of what it means to be young in a world that invented more ways to tell stories than we had ever imagined.In fact, I wonder if the team that built the Instagram “Stories” feature thought carefully about what to call it. They hit the nail right on the head. The core deliverable on the Stories product wasn’t the ability to geotag or add filters. It was how it appealed to our generations’ most pressing desire: the need to feel seen.Now this isn’t going to be another think piece on the notion of “Me First” culture. As a 23-year-old employee of 23andMe, I would be setting myself up for a lot of jokes. Instead, I want to share what I’ve learned from sitting at the cusp of two generations who have so much to teach each other. Maybe you can learn something, too?Most people identify the defining difference between the two to be the memory of 9/11.(Side note: It’s interesting that people refer to Millennials as though they are individual beings. Millennials do this and that. But Gen Z is a collective. It makes grammar a particular challenge.)Okay, did that effectively distract from the emotional saliency of mentioning 9/11? My memory of 9/11 was that it was supposed to be my second day of kindergarten when I lived on Long Island, NY. I remember being sent home. I ended up on my mother’s bed staring at the tv, not understanding why everyone was so scared. Each year after the event, while I still lived in the state, my school held a memorial. New York is slow to forget. That’s why so many Millennials live there.The influence of the Internet emerged certainly during my adolescence. I came of age just in time for everybody to jump ship from MySpace to relax on Facebook island and AIM got different (better?) sound effects. But I did not have a phone of my own until I was *gasp* 12 years old. Someone had to explain to me the purpose of Instagram for the first time. Then, I watched it become the vehicle for all of Gen Z’s anxiety.Part of me felt a “kids these days” mentality about it all. “Oh, they’re just breeding their own self destruction so that they can feel things. Been there, done that.” But another part of me resisted following that mental path, the one that almost everyone in previous generations has taken. It’s easier. It’s easier to believe that you could have effortlessly faced the problems of the generation after you.The reality is we’re not judging those younger than us because they’re of a different generation. We judge them because we’re older than them. We think we understand more. Even though we resented that our parents thought they knew more than us. And we don’t like when we see that the anxieties of the age we suffered through have changed over time. Because we, too, are looking to be seen and understood by everyone else. It would be easier to offer our empathy to a generation we saw go through the same struggles.Sometimes, when I’m around Millennials talking about Gen Zers, I feel like an undercover agent. That I’m researching the user experience for the Gen Z product. “Okay, you guys, so they like the memes and the photographic ambition. They don’t like the hashtags and the pictures of every food you’ve ever eaten.” I wish I could tell them that I see them. That I understand what it’s like to be reduced to your online persona or to be limited by how much money you have or to have a secret you can’t tell your parents. But do I? Do I really know how the Internet has shaped these experiences?It seems like the thing we all need to learn is the ability to empathize with people who are not like us. To stop obsessing over the need to be seen for who we are but to focus on seeing someone else. To celebrate somehow who deserves to be celebrated. Someone who isn’t you.The truth is that the only factor that increases what there is to write about is time. With each passing day, more and more stories unfold. In fact, the world is drowning in stories, each one different from the next yet just as compelling. That’s why we need the most gifted storytellers to organize these thoughts into something coherent and shed some insight. To speak as the voice of many voices combined. Well, the only way to get there is to listen.Is that why writers are so quiet?----Clay Slang--Clay Slang----Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Clay Slang,https://medium.com/@leahslang,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HsDZk3CI28rWQFBi9c1axg.png",5,3

A great business partner can transform your entrepreneurial journey, but how do you find the right person? I’d like to share my road-tested tips from building a successful tech startup, excerpted and adapted from my new book, Mechanical Bull: How You Can Achieve Startup Success.Many nontraditional entrepreneurs start their first venture alone for various reasons. For example, a stay-at-home mom’s professional network is not what it was when she was working full time. A younger person may still be building a professional network and doesn’t think she has the necessary connections to form a partnership or team.In order to find people who share your passion and can get behind your idea, bring it out in the open and talk about it. It’s important to create paths to break through whatever your barrier is in order to give your concept the greatest chance of life.As you talk about your idea and meet people who are interested, get to know them. If someone seems like they’d like to work with you, follow your gut. Don’t ignore your intuition just because they have a great résumé or lots of connections. You’ll know on the inside whether or not this is the right person. The questions and doubts that emerge from that gut level are usually right.Likewise, if someone with a thinner résumé seems like a good match, think about how their strengths derived from life experiences may fill in for your weaknesses. Have they overcome great odds? Are they determined and persistent? Are they super smart or an amazing coder? If part of their experience is thin, look for balancing attributes.When looking for cofounders, assess their management experience. You don’t hear much about the importance of management skills, but a lack of those skills can cause a lot of problems when you begin to grow. At the beginning stages of most startups, there are only a few people, and everyone is doing all the work. Each person manages themselves but often no one else. As you scale the company, some people can’t transition from building the team to managing the team. If you bring in a co-founder who doesn’t have management experience, that’s on you.Look for people who have done the things that they say they’ve done. Make sure they have relevant experience. Being your husband’s third cousin is not relevant experience. Those are two different things. Just because Peanut and Ray-Ray want to work in your company and are available doesn’t mean that’s a good idea. Peanut and Ray-Ray can find their own jobs without your help.Every person on your team needs to bring their maximum to the table. Make the best choices you can. Be exquisitely careful in selecting your initial people because each one can make or break the success of your venture.Jeanette Russell led our marketing at our startup Attentive.ly. She was amazing and now works at Blackbaud, who acquired us as a senior solutions nonprofit marketer. She believes that working at a startup accelerated her career and says,Working for a startup can be an opportunity of a lifetime to develop your skills and confidence by creating a unique space for you to shine. Whether you’re a seasoned professional, a recent graduate, or simply feel like your talents aren’t aligned with your current job, the startup life allows you to hack and hustle your way to a radically empowering path.Because each role is critical to the survival of the company, you will be put into a sink-or-swim situation which will test your ability to adapt to the problem of the day. Imagine being a department of one, performing core daily tasks, in addition to finding out about, oh let’s say, losing access to a key data stream which happened to be a competitive differentiator…and that’s just Monday. It’s a wild ride.Lastly, make sure you like and trust the people you bring on. You are in a startup, it’s ride or die, and this is your posse. One of the things that most commonly sinks young companies is infighting among the founding team. To provide a nerdy analogy, you want to form a Voltron — a super-robot that’s actually a bunch of smaller robots that create a bigger robot to better defend the universe. You do not want a bunch of robots fighting with each other, messing up Earth like one might see in the Transformers movies.We asked our friend Charlene Li, Principal Analyst at Altimeter and author of the classic Groundswell, “How did you find your cofounders and prevent infighting among you?” She said,Honestly, we weren’t very good at it! They are all good people, but we had a fundamental underlying difference of how we looked at the world and wanted to run the company. We tried to create a core set of values. Although we agreed to them, our interpretation of them was wildly different! The best thing we did was to incorporate feedback, training, and processes, and that helped tremendously by creating a foundation of transparency and trust. That allowed us to put out in the open any disagreements, and when the time came for departures, they were a lot easier because we knew we wanted to do well by each other.Your cofounders will be in the thick of things right beside you, so trust your gut and make your decision wisely — the success of your business depends on it.For more advice on starting your entrepreneurial journey, you can find Mechanical Bull on Amazon.Cheryl Contee is the award-winning CEO and co-founder of Do Big Things, which brings together a diverse team that uses new narrative and new tech like blockchain, AI, bots and machine learning to make the world a better place for everyone.

Check out more content here.Software developers face many challenges from the very beginning of their careers . Learning to develop software is a challenge big enough.Then, when you start working, the feeling that you don’t know anything comes along and getting on track is another obstacle to get through. Three days are a failure and the fourth one is a success — that’s the magic circle of the job.When you finally think you’ve started getting how things work around here, there comes another unexpected obstacle. This one might be harder to pass through than the previous ones because it’s more of a psychological one. It’s called code shaming.Our family and closest friends are always here to be happy about our successes. Good colleagues will always congratulate on a job well done. However, there always seems to be this line of people that are waiting for us to fail. Their existence makes us feel like failure comes more often than success and that we’re not good enough. Simply because they’re too loud.There will almost always be someone like that at work. Code-shaming isn’t new, it’s just not being mentioned a lot. Basically, code-shaming means making fun of other developers for the poor code they’ve created.Code-shamers mock other coders with the thought of being “funny” in front of others and showing the “great” coders they are. This unnecessary act disrupts the whole existence of the programming community, which is known as generally supportive of new people. This industry relies on the need for discussion and advice. Constructive and valuable. Now, code-shaming raises a question: Is this the future industry you want to have?Some developer teams publicly shame people who did something wrong and somehow opened more work for everyone. This often happens on Slack or on company meetings, when everyone is present. Yes, we get your frustration, but have you never made any mistakes?It might look funny to you, but this can be really discouraging for people who are beginners and still learning. If you do it too often, it kind of looks like you’re just trying to put the blame on someone else and defend your own “perfect” coding way.“The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything.” — William Connor MageeAfter this, young coders who are being shamed tend to communicate less and don’t ask for help that often. Instead of trying to learn new things, they focus too much on not to screw up the things they already know. However, it’s essential for them to understand that mistakes happen to everyone. What they should do is learn how to fix what they did and try not to repeat the same mistakes. It’s on their colleagues to make sure this learning process happens without guilt and shame.Senior developers often review the code of their younger colleagues to make sure things run according to the company’s standards. The purpose of this code review is to give junior developers constructive feedback and tell them if something they did can be done better. Senior developers shouldn’t take advantage of their position to harass juniors that their code “sucks” or they are “bad coders”. Instead, this should be turned into a learning opportunity where seniors mentor juniors and help them become better. Take it as a way seniors can give back to the community.Another thing to think about is shaming developers about the tools they’re using. Yes, there are company standards and everyone should work according to them. But, tools that are beyond company standards are a personal choice and you simply don’t get a vote here. Everyone gets to choose the way they work. You can’t simply say someone is a bad developer just because they don’t do things your way.When giving feedback, there should be a balance between requiring quality and giving constructive advice. The limit of unpoliteness should never be crossed. You’ll always be more respected if you know how to disagree in a polite way.However, not everyone is the same. There will always be people who just won’t bother to be nice. These are the type of people who simply don’t listen to the arguments of others. This is where employers play a big role. They are the ones who are supposed to “estimate” the level of politeness of a potential candidate and whether this person can contribute to a friendly atmosphere.The same goes for candidates. Think about whether your potential employers can give you the working atmosphere that makes you comfortable.Wrong choices can bring serious consequences. People usually don’t think about them when they decide to shame someone. They don’t consider that the mistakes could be a result of some larger issue. Small children, divorce, debts — we all carry our burden. The life of a developer isn’t all about a successful tech company with tons of benefits, private healthcare, and free lunches. Most of them don’t have this, actually.The combination of all these problems + a stressful work environment most often leads to anxiety. Unfortunately, anxiety has been linked to the software developing industry a lot lately. It kind of seems like it comes with the job.People even leave their jobs and pursue new careers because of this issue. When we hear that a developer has made a career switch, we often think they didn’t try enough, or that they were too weak. We never actually think that they might have been suffering from shaming, guilt, and anxiety.Code-shaming is toxic. And totally unnecessary. In fact, how your company treats juniors is a perfect picture of its culture. Developers don’t have to become “tough” just to remain sane. Respecting individuals is the core of every healthy company culture.Laika is a platform for matching Balkan Tech professionals with IT Companies.

47,26790,https://medium.com/@waykichainwicc/waykichain-multi-signature-technology-9365c3d77640?source=tag_archive---------121-----------------------,WaykiChain Multi-Signature Technology,None,"WaykiChain WICCFollow--ListenShareWaykiChain will apply multi-signature technology in transactions in the latest updated version. Previously, the transfer transaction can only be unilaterally signed by the initiator, so it is impossible to introduce the third party guarantee platform such as eBay in transactions. WaykiChain multi-signature technology opens the door for more upper-level applications in blockchain transaction scenarios.What is Multi-Signature?Multi-Signature refers to the crypto transaction authorized by multiple keys, which is typically used to define the ownership of crypto assets. In the traditional crypto account, each of your crypto assets addresses has a corresponding private key, which can be called “single-signature transaction”. But for multi-signature address, you will have multiple associated private keys, and you need more than one of them to complete a transfer transaction.For M-N multi-signature model (1 ≤ M ≤ N), N individuals respectively hold N private keys, and to complete the transaction at least M individuals’ signatures are needed. In fact, you can set M-N to 1–3, 5–5, 6–11, but the most common used one is 2–3 model, that is, with at least 2 of 3 people’s signatures the assets in this “multi-signature address” can be used.Advantages of Multi-SignatureStrengthen Asset SecurityThough the current cryptography can guarantee that a single private key won’t be decoded, it is still not safe enough. Your private key may be hacked by Trojan or exposed accidentally, then the your assets are also exposed. But if the public key is generated by multi-signature, even if one of the private keys is stolen, the hacker cannot transfer your digital assets either.Extensional Use ScenariosFund Supervision: With multi-signature, multiple parties’ authorization are needed to protect the safety of funds. For example, a fund account owned by three partners will require at least two signatures of them to use the funds, effectively preventing anyone from illegally diverting funds.E-commerce: Under multi-signature model, besides the buyer and seller, an “intermediary” playing the arbitration role can be introduced into the transaction. For example, under 2–3 multi-signature model, when the buyer and seller are caught into a dispute, the arbitrator will ensure that the funds are fairly divided according to the actual situation.How WaykiChain’s Multi-Signature Works?WaykiChain is a third-generation public chain that supports Turing-complete smart contracts. Therefore, multi-signature is naturally supported by smart contracts. On the other hand, WaykiChain implements multi-signature transactions as a basic transaction type, with the following features:1. All-round RPC Support: Generate multi-signature address; View multi-signature address scripts; Create multi-signal transactions; Sign multi-signal transactions, etc. Further lower the thresholds to use multi-signature technology.2. Simplified Signature Data: With WaykiChain’s unique RegID, the length of the public key can be simplified into 6 bytes, much shorter than 33 bytes in Bitcoin’s multi-signature script.WaykiChain’s multi-signature is easy and efficient for users and developers to use in transactions.Example：2–3 Multi-Signature ModelParse multi-signature address via decodemulsigscript2.

Blockchain is but a twinkle in the stars and early homo sapiens have begun exchanging goods with each other in their tribes. They are happily building their start-up businesses without a trendy coffee bar in sight. The foundation of these enterprises is absolute trust within their tribe. Then, as the population explodes, business explodes with it, and markets develop where people are no longer trading solely within their trusted tribes but with strangers they cannot implicitly trust.Enter the middleman! A person who presents themselves as an unshakably trustworthy individual selflessly facilitating transactions between strangers. Unfortunately this was not the case and these middlemen became experts in asserting undue influence, control and ineptitude on transactions. From what began as pure peer-to-peer exchange had now become a business environment fraught with self-interested middlemen creating inefficiencies in the system.Jump forward to 2008. Inefficient and self-interested financial middlemen have now created a global financial crisis in which trillions of dollars have been wiped out and the trust in all middlemen is at an all-time low. In rides Satoshi Nakamoto with the first widespread discussion of how a technology called blockchain could re-assert control back in to the hands of the people and away from the middlemen. The principle is based on distributing information across a network of users who each have identical records and so hold each other to account on the ‘truth’ of transactions. No single player has the ability for undue influence or control for self-interest. Bingo!While the initial idea was focused on so-called peer-to-peer electronic cash (or crypto-currencies), the principle can be converted into any system where middlemen play an inefficient role in a transaction.In 2018 Four found there to be a real-life opportunity in which blockchain could genuinely help an existing inefficient practice. We saw that we could use the technology to improve media transparency and efficiency in programmatic advertising. As a bit of background, the programmatic advertising ecosystem is at its worst rife with opacity, fraud, and inefficient middle players not giving value in transactions. Advertisers’ precious media budgets are unknowingly swallowed up along the buying process and there is little transparency on both price or performance efficiency.So we created a new approach in which blockchain was threaded throughout the programmatic ecosystem, tracking and monitoring every transaction to create a clear and trusted picture of price and performance efficiency. With this new found clarity and transparency our experts have been able to deliver an immediate 25% efficiency on this blockchain pilot. A wonderful case of how blockchain actually is the solution to a problem we knew we had!It’s not easy to assess whether blockchain is right for your business. The World Economic Forum’s decision tree, Blockchain: Beyond the Hype, is very helpful. Ask yourselves the following three questions:1. Are you trying to remove intermediaries or brokers?2. Are you working with digital assets (versus physical assets)?3. Can you create a permanent, authoritative record of the digital asset in question?If you answer ‘no’ to any of these then it is not for you. However if you make it through with three yeses then it just might be something to look further at.If this has whetted your appetite for blockchain then there are plenty of superb case studies which can inspire you further. Here are just a few:e-Estonia has health records stored on a national blockchain platformBuilding blocks is a programme using blockchain within refugee camps to re-build identity and enterprise amongst refugeesLantmäteriet (Swedish land-ownership authority) is testing property transactions completed using blockchain functionalitySmart Dubai (Dubai’s blockchain strategy) is helping Dubai achieve the vision of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum by making Dubai “the first city fully powered by Blockchain by 2020”Blocking out the hype of this emerging technology can be tricky, however there are successful routes being paved by companies that show blockchain to be a viable yet specific business tool to use. Watch this space for how Four take our interest in this topic further.----An experienced Director within global healthcare media, driving digital innovation to improve how we communicate… particularly interested in blockchainRichard Springham--Richard Springham--Richard Springham--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alex Mathers--227Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Richard Springham,https://medium.com/@r_springham,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vjlAcPSGVHGVNR1WRw8lCA.jpeg",3,5

This often happened in public spaces and family gatherings where my older and younger cousins would be so absorbed towards their devices. Something very sudden as an event that used to be filled with loud chatters of conversations silenced to the brushing movement of the wind. Crouched backs facing towards a bright screen, having a white cord connected to their ears from their electronic device was something that became a common view.At the age of 15, my family friend introduced me to multiple social media accounts such as Instagram, snapchat and twitter. Although I found most of those social media accounts to be identical to Facebook which I don’t use often, I was intrigued about what was so beneficial and engaging towards devoting your attention to the web. I started to engage myself towards different social media platforms, wanting to understand why peers around me held digital technology to such high importance. Although I found the social media application to be indistinguishable to one another, I slowly became dissolved into the web.Being able to connect to new people so suddenly, forming new friendships, was something I didn’t experience that often in my usual lifestyle. I often talk to my friends in person, either during school hours, extra curriculum events and regular gatherings. Contrasting my previous lifestyle towards communicating with friends on a constant basis, gave me an overwhelming feeling of joy and excitement.In the next two years, my life as a digital native (coined by Marc Prensky) has been dedicated towards my phone. My days now consisted of staring towards my screen, now majority using the web only as a source of communication rather than research and entertainment. One day in a game of monopoly, I found myself reminiscing about my childhood when I spent all my time with my elder siblings. I couldn’t help but realise how long ago it was that we had spent time as a family. Being too caught up towards being engaged in the internet and web, essentially led me to neglect my family in the process.I never realised how significant technology and the web was towards me once I was this engaged towards it. Whilst the pros of the web have allowed me to expand my social surroundings and given me new knowledge about the world, it also leads to a con as I used the web so much that it negatively impacted towards my relationship with my family as well as my eyesight vision. I had experienced an addiction to the internet, following the characteristics pointed out by Hing Keung Ma’s research article (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2011/308631/).How an individual uses technology, determines the type of relationship it plays upon their lifestyle.

The researchers, along with the executives, managers, engineers, salespeople, and consultants they interviewed, very astutely acknowledged that in order for an organization to increase the value it brings to its customers, the organization must increase the communication and collaboration amongst the aforementioned (and really all) business units.The “Cross-Silo Leadership” article listed four practices that everyone within an organization can pursue in order to increase collaboration and further dissolve company silos. In this article, I’d like to introduce a fifth practice: DevOps.Before we get into DevOps, the four practices the article suggests are:Each practice demonstrates how people from different business units can begin to understand each other and each other’s work, thus creating the cultural broker: people who facilitate greater cross-company collaboration. These syncretic humans have “experiences and relationships that span multiple sectors, functions, or domains and informally serve as links between them”. The more people can bridge gaps between the different organization silos (such as sales, engineering, and marketing) the more innovation, sales, and growth the organization will see.The fifth practice (it’s actually more of an approach) is DevOps. What is DevOps? DevOps is a way to promote collaboration among business units to decrease the amount of time it takes to address customer feedback, increase innovation, and make a company (yes, even the large organizations!) more agile. There are six workflows within IBM DevOps, which very nicely align with the four practices from the article:Now I must contradict myself briefly for clarification. The six aforementioned approaches do not in any way represent the four general practices to increase company collaboration. DevOps is a technical approach to collaboration, geared towards application development, while the four practices are people-oriented in order to increase creativity and productivity. However, what I have done here is the point of the article itself. We see a connection between people and technology. At the end of the day, it’s very important to bridge the gap between people, technology and across organizational silos.----Entrepreneur, IBM Technology Leader in Cloud, WellPower, New York City (hey I’m writing here!), dogs, fashion, ideas expressed are my ownVictoriainCloud Chats--Victoria--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Victoria,https://medium.com/@vscott2018,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Oe5w3Hzq5H9TTA46T_U4XA.jpeg",2,11
52,33767,https://medium.com/sciforce/is-the-4th-industrial-revolution-underway-823878df1104?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,Is the 4th Industrial Revolution Underway?,Current state,"SciforceFollowSciforce--ListenShareIn 1965, the American engineer Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors per silicon chip would double every year. This observation, called Moore’s law, underpinned long-term planning strategies and shaped our ideas of future for several decades. Since 2012 the pace of advancement was declining steadily, and in 2017 Intel stated the era of Moore’s law is over and it is hyperscaling that would be able to continue the trend and offset the increased cadence by aggressively scaling beyond the typical doubling of transistors.Apart from the evident slowing-down of the rate of change, we see new technologies and innovation bubble — just think of the infamous Theranos project. We see that the revered self-driving cars, virtual reality and even AI itself are still in their infantry and will remain there for years. At still we hear a lot about the 4th Industrial Revolution. So is the world changing or is it just a fantasy?But first of all…It is usually referred to as an environment in which disruptive technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing our lives and business. The author The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Professor Klaus Schwab claims that the new age stands out by the speed of technological breakthroughs, the pervasiveness of scope and the tremendous impact of new systems.With the abundance of digital devices, many manufacturers believe they are leading their markets towards Industry 4.0 technologies. Worldwide, businesses are piloting different Industry 4.0 solutions, mainly across connectivity, intelligence and flexible automation. However, in most cases, they are merely exploring digital manufacturing strategies — applying automation, robotics, AI, and the Internet of Things — rather than implementing them successfully. The evidence is that over 70% of businesses investing in big data analytics, artificial intelligence or 3D printing would not take the projects beyond the pilot phase.To aid the process of learning and adoption of technologies by other companies, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has selected nine so-called lighthouses, the world’s smartest factories when it comes to adopting industrial IoT (IIoT) technologies. These companies have created factories that have 20–50% higher performance and create a competitive edge. They have certain common things: agile teams with domain, analytics, IoT and software development expertise; a common data/IoT platform; and up to 15 use cases already in action.All nine lighthouses — five in Europe, three in China and one in the USA — have agreed to share their knowledge with other manufacturing businesses in the effort to build a network of similar pioneering manufacturers to address problems connected with investing in advanced technologies.If we compare their approaches, we can figure out the main trends that we will see in the near future as a result of the Industry 4.0 advancement:As a part of factory automation, robotics and robots are entering new environments and creating new value for manufacturers. Similar to tectonic shifts in the labor market induced by previous industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 demands new skills to maximize the potential of the digital economy. A recent WEF Future of Jobs Report 2018 shows that AI and related technologies will bring about a net gain in employment. In this process, jobs will be both lost and created, and more people will get training in STEM, engineering and data sciences, as well as up-skilling of their existing expertise.Top technologies that are predicted to shape the industry in 2019 will be the core of future transition to Industry 4.0. Such technologies as 5G & Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) will provide workers on the factory floor with the access to data analytics and vital alerts from multiple data points. Equipped with automated and intelligent applications via phones and tablets, factory workers will be able to improve their efficiency, collaboration, and decision-making to become more informed and mobile workforce.Digital twins, on the other hand, will assist businesses in modelling their production lines, processes, and networks in a virtual environment. With the help of digital twins, businesses will predict problems to boost productivity and efficiency. By combining this with sensors that monitor temperature, pressure, RPM, and other critical factors, factory workers will be able to prevent problems more effectively and react faster.The heart of the new industrial revolution, the Internet of Things, is supposed to help companies avoid overstocking, downtime, and unnecessary fuel usage. It can optimize maintenance schedules and output, monitor critical processes, increase opportunities for automation, and better understand customers.The central place in the IoT-driven smart factory belongs to Artificial Intelligence that helps manufacturers predict demand patterns and allocate resources accurately. Coupled with Big Data analytics, AI allows manufacturers to answer questions based on cold, hard data rather than human guesswork.The 4th Industrial Revolution goes far beyond a technological shift. It is a vast social phenomenon, intertwined with the globalization processes and the modern idea of “global village” built on digital foundations.Globalization and technology are intimately interconnected: on the one hand, movement of people, goods and ideas is accelerated and broadened by new forms of transportation and communication. In this process, technology plays a defining role in creating new opportunities and risks. Besides, being a product of human thought, technological development is enhanced by the diversity of ideas and the increased scale that come globally.All recent developments prove that the 4th Industrial Revolution is real. We already live in the world of the Internet of Things. Even in our daily lives, we navigate through an invisible IoT network, relying on device-to-device communications as different devices and objects send commands and exchange our data with one another. We live in the era of smart devices when workers and management equally get augmented with technology.Industry 4.0 will deliver productivity gains and transform the future of manufacturing, but we are still at the beginning of the journey. The confluence of technologies will shift manufacturing away from its quest for the lowest labor cost towards more personalized, automated, and localized value chains, based on customer needs. And this, in turn, will pave the way for smart homes where everything is controlled with a button, for connected cars, and for the long-expected marvel of robotics.----SciforceUkraine-based IT company specialized in development of software solutions based on science-driven information technologies #AI #ML #IoT #NLP #Healthcare #DevOpsSciforceinSciforce--SciforceinSciforce--SciforceinSciforce--SciforceinSciforce--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Sciforce,https://medium.com/@sciforce,3,5,75

59,15707,https://medium.com/@craig_10243/saving-research-97c9e63a3756?source=tag_archive---------30-----------------------,Saving research,A dealer-less blinded ECDSA threshold key,"Craig Wright (Bitcoin SV is Bitcoin.)Follow--1ListenShareToday’s business post is about a method to record research and development data in a way that is tamper-proof and allows privacy, review, and a means to validate the results.One nChain invention that will come out soon is one we describe as providing a distribution protocol for blind dealer-less thresholds.The simplest answer to how we can help scientific research lies in saving data as its obtained. It can be either the full data, blinded data, encrypted data, or a hash that proves the existence of data at a point in time. Having said so, today I will detail something more in depth.As such, we use Bitcoin-transaction scripting to create a means of sending a verified user response. That is, we can issue a questionnaire and link each response back to individuals while maintaining full privacy and scientific double blinding. We know that we have issued the survey or other material to an authorised and validated party, and yet we also know that we cannot tell who will have responded in each event.As such, Alice can authenticate to Bob, and once she has validated her identity, she can set up a blinded address. Bob will be able to respond to the blinded address without knowing it is Alice that he was receiving data from.The method relates to a distribution protocol for blind dealer-less thresholds used on the Metanet. In the described system, Alice OR an Alice group creates a blinded version of a message by means of secret sharing, and sends the blinded message to a Bob group. The Bob group then creates a signed version of the blinded message by means of secret sharing, and sends the signed blinded message to the Alice group. The Alice group then creates an un-blinded version of the signed message by means of secret sharing, and obtains the un-blinded message, signed by the Bob group, from a threshold number of shares.Alice and Bob can now communicate and exchange surveys, research data, and more using a blinded ECDSA key. As Alice is the party to be blinded, it’s more important for her to have control of the system, but at the same time, we can also create a threshold scheme such that Alice can be double-blinded from the people handling the results. Alice submits her blinded keys and transactions that she has received and signed to the blockchain.Bob can now communicate with Alice knowing that it is an address he has created for her, yet simultaneously does not know which particular individual he is communicating with. The same mechanism could also be used in voting.Bob and Alice verify each other out of band. The transaction to be used can be atomically swapped or swapped by using oblivious transfers over Bitcoin transactions.Alice can complete a survey and then blind the hash that she sends to Bob. Bob can then verify the identity of Alice through unrelated communication channels, and such a process can also be blinded.Bob signs a blinded hash, the one he just received from Alice, and returns the signature.Alice can then un-blind the signature to obtain a valid Bitcoin transaction that she can send to the blockchain.Bob will not know which transaction he has helped Alice sign, yet can be sure that she is a member of the party of research subjects.I am not going to detail the full process here; it will be published in the patent shortly. The figure above demonstrates some of the complexity of the system. In time, it will be released in SDKs allowing users to implement such methods without understanding the full background process.The end result is a combination of both voting, secure research methodologies, and even the ability to pseudonymously issue forms that can be double-blinded and allow for validated individuals to complete research and surveys without giving away their identity.----1My opinions are my own.

All the remaining flags colors were clearly out of gamut. That is, standard displays were not capable of reproducing the colors properly. Only those fans using wide gamut sets could see their colors in a 4K HDR broadcast.As for a web workflow, it is much more involved than the display properties. Textures, saturation, hue or brightness may be far more important in other industries than in football — just think of fashion or the art imagery in ecommerce. In such cases, clean color management is key to deploying healthy and reliable image and video processing and optimization pipelines.However, color management in ecommerce and in general in web workflows may unfold as a tricky issue. My recent experience with complex ecommerce teams involving photographers, retouchers and devops to debug and deploy image and video optimization solutions only reinforces this idea.In this article, I shortly revise the basic concepts involved in color management, the best practices, and the challenges posed by the latest trends in display technology.Humans with healthy color vision have three types of color detectors in the retina. Each of these types of detectors respond with different strengths to spectral colors, from red to violet. As a result, any physical color that we perceive can be represented as the combination of three chromatic primaries.This fact allowed us — nearly 90 years ago — to define the first colorimetry standard to convert the physical magnitudes of light into a numeric representation uniquely related to colors. It set the basis to accurately represent any color (of light reaching the eye) by a simple array of three numbers.Digital cameras and displays were designed to convey images of scenes that a human eye is able to see as if it were right there looking at them. So, cameras capture a trichromatic representation of the scene and code it in a digital file.To do this, cameras simply :) have three types of light detectors (R, G, and B) like our retina has. Likewise, displays transform digital values in trichromatic signals that drive the generation of light to recreate the image stored in a digital file. To do it, displays simply :) have three types of light emitters (R, G and B).It seems easy: The camera mimics the eye and the display projects light to mimic the scene, finally conveying it to the eye, anytime, anywhere.But there are…Some related to the physics and some related to perception.Just to start with, the spectral sensitivities of the three detectors of a camera sensor are different — very different indeed — from our eye’s light detectors (our eye’s detectors are not R, G, and B). Moreover, different camera sensors exhibit quite different behaviors (their R, G, and B are different). Color perception is clearly non-linear with physical magnitudes like the intensity of light. But sensors are typically linear with light intensity.In the end, this means that to provide accurate color representations, cameras should be calibrated. Calibration is done by shooting an image of a pattern of colors. A color profile is then created that transforms the sensor response into a standard representation of color. But this should be done for different lighting.Put in simple words, if we seek true color fidelity we would need to calibrate to correct color for each new scene! And any slight change of lighting means that the scene has changed as well. Fortunately, depending on the specific need of accuracy and the flexibility of the workflow, the requirements of calibration can be relaxed.Something similar happens to displays, but the other way. They translate the colors coded within image files into light emitted. Slight changes in the amount of light emitted have an impact on the color effectively displayed.That’s why professional displays need to be calibrated from time to time. The light emitted for some primaries is checked and a display color profile is created. This profile is used to transform the stored pixel values to actual light with the intended color. Needless to say, user displays are not calibrated, but they usually have a factory color profile instead.We should acknowledge that current LED technology has greatly limited the variation of color properties among different units of the same display model and also in the same display through time.If all this were not enough, our brain excels in assuring color constancy under different lighting conditions. To do it, a variety of mechanisms are constantly adjusting perception in order to match the expected color based on the scene context. This is done regardless true values of the physical color. You may pick the digital RGB values in A and B in this classic illusion (check the original here, since Medium alters the image).They are exactly the same: The display sends the same light from each of them. Even after knowing so, you will see A darker than B. I see it as I’m writing this. Such a tricky perception is a powerful reason for many photographers to adjust colors by hand rather than using a calibrated scene reference.However, things may still get worse, much worse. At this point, we should have noticed that speaking about color with the same language is important if we want to keep consistent. To accomplish this need, we should manage color. In other words, our software should be color managed. A failure to manage color in a web workflow will undermine the consistency of the user experience.With this aim, different color spaces have been developed. Each color space aims to support a use case in the best possible way. Three examples of use cases are:Each color space has an associated color profile to interpret the stored RGB values in a file. There are many handy tools out there to check the color space of an image. For instance, the inspector tool of Preview in Mac.To check every detail about an image, I find it very convenient to use exiftool. It reveals the color profile, among many other metadata.You should see something like thisWith videos, Mediainfo is a handy tool with a simple and usable graphic interface. Putting the pointer over the Video area, detailed metadata of the video appears, including the color space at the bottom.sRGB: based on Rec. 709Created by HP and Microsoft, this color space was specially aimed at the Internet. It is based on BT.709 (or Rec 709) standard for video, adding gamma suited to CRT displays. But it’s also suited to average human perception. This means that it makes an efficient use of the dynamic range.This is the color space universally supported throughout the web. Any image (or web element) without an explicit color profile (that is an undefined color space) will be interpreted by any web browser as being sRGB. Moreover, any decent display is sRGB capable: it can reproduce the whole sRGB color gamut. At the time of this writing, this is the safest color space in a web context.If you assure that ALL your workflow, from studio to web delivery, is (well) done in sRGB, then the colors of the images in your web will be consistent for everybody. You may be confident of this.In case you find a non sRGB image and you need a quick fix, Little CMS is a handy tool to get the job done. Whatever color profile has the image, you may convert it to sRGB by simply usingHowever, remember that the best practice is working from the beginning in sRGB. When transforming from a wider space, out of gamut colors may be treated differently — and in some cases colors may be clipped while in other cases they may be washed out. It depends on the rendering intent.The inconvenience of sRGB is that your gamut will be more limited than a good percentage of current display technology, with this percentage increasing steadily. Recall the beginning of this article. Unless you are French or Argentinian, chances are that you won’t see your country colors properly in a standard sRGB monitor. Or in other contexts, everybody buying cloths online is deciding purchases based on untrue colors (shown on uncalibrated displays!). But if the web sticks to sRGB, the mismatch experienced by each user will be at least consistent, limiting the chance of bad surprises.Adobe RGBIt is the classic color space used in the graphics industry. It has a wider gamut than sRGB and covers fairly the gamut relevant in the production of prints. To work with it, you will need a profesional calibrated wide gamut display capable of Adobe RGB.Unless images are intended to be printed rather than viewed in a display, this color profile does not make sense in a web workflow. I include it here because I have found it several times in such a context.Since it is the preferred color space of photographers and retouchers that print their work, some people think of it as implying higher quality than sRGB. Adjusting color in a color space and saving the image in a different one may end up being a waste of time and bringing unexpected results, specially in the presence of highly saturated tones.If you are asked to optimise pristine images with this color profile you are likely facing upstream issues coming from the retouching or studio teams. Problems may be even worse if you find Adobe ProPhoto, with an even larger gamut.DCI-P3 (or simply P3).This color space has been adopted by Apple in their wide gamut displays since 2016. Other brands recently embracing wide gamut have also adopted P3. Although with a similar size to Adobe RGB, it spans a different gamut, better suited to displays — light projection technology — instead of prints. It is an intermediate step towards UHDTV, aimed at 8k TV and film industry. It is good for high quality streaming that may cater to 4K HDR capable displays.The use of P3 results in much richer and deeper colors, with a true impact on user experience and color fidelity. Back to the world cup example, P3 would greatly improve the color fidelity and deliver true colors for most fans. It’s easy to think about a similar benefit for imagery in a fashion, cooking or traveling websites.UHDTV /Rec. 2020This color space has been designed for 4k and 8k HDR TVs. It brings a wider gamut compared to P3. It contains P3 as well. Even for HDR TVs this standard is still the future. It does not make much sense in a today’s web workflow.If you own a wide gamut display and enjoy healthy color vision, a first hand visual check is the best and quickest way to understand and assess the differences among color profiles. A good starting point is to use wide gamut images specially prepared to compare color spaces.Unless you are determined to be a wide gamut pioneer, color management will be synonym of enforcing the sRGB color space throughout the image processing pipeline.A good practice is to calibrate the camera at least with a dual illuminant calibration. Of course, the use of specific calibrations for specific lighting will always be better. In the studio, the more fixed your lighting settings are (so you don’t need to recalibrate), the better. If you directly shoot jpegs in sRGB instead of RAW, your calibration should be done in sRGB.When iPhones are used to shoot, the color space may be an issue since iPhone cameras are set to DCI-P3 by default.Just after shooting, any color correction in darkroom software should be already done in sRGB. Retouching should be done in sRGB. You will avoid issues related to rendering intent choice. The same applies to artwork and visual creativities.The software used should be color managed. This is the case of most image editing and graphics packages. In the case of video, there was a notable exception: Adobe Premiere Pro versions prior to October 2018 did not manage color.If Premiere is used in post-production for web, the best practice is using a calibrated sRGB display. Otherwise, you may end up with video colors that will change (typically washed out) when viewed in the web. This is why so many Premiere users on iMAC displays usually oversaturate their videos, in order to avoid washed out exported results.If the sRGB rule is observed, the only risks to color due to generation and optimization of derivatives will be compression artifacts related to low q values or excessive chroma downsampling.Don’t be fooled by old stuff posted saying that browsers are not color managed. It’s only the proof that being highly ranked in Google search is no guarantee of accurate and up to date information. All the major web browsers (from Safari, to Firefox, Edge, or Chrome) are currently color managed and capable of interpreting ICC profiles.If you have many iOS and macOS users you may be tempted by the P3 color space. You would bring them a much more realistic experience, with far more vibrant colors.But in 2019 it is still a risky move. All the other users with average sRGB displays may experience either washed out or oversaturated images. The impact will always depend on the specific picture and the browser, since browsers may use different rendering intents. For instance in macOS — as of January 2019 — Chrome (version 71) and Safari (version 12) use perceptual intent, while Firefox (version 64) uses colorimetric intent.Serving two manually adjusted versions to take the wide gamut advantage on iOS users while still serving optimum sRGB images… would require you to adjust colors in both spaces. The benefits are unlikely to balance the burden for photography and retouch teams.A good practice from studio to web is sticking end to end to the same color space. In most (practically all) cases this means sticking to sRGB.When different sources of images and video cater to the workflow, this requires awareness for all the people involved in the image creation and processing chain.However, display technology has recently moved from racing on resolution to racing on color gamut. So, we should keep an eye on the P3 color space and the tech used by our users. As more and more of them purchase wide gamut displays, switching to images with a P3 color profile may start to make sense.----We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/newsProviding tools to analyse, process, transcode, and deliver images and videos, on the shoulders of state-of-the-art cloud, media and AI technology.Antón Garcia--2TKinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--132Preethi KasireddyinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--111Antón GarciainAbraia--3The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Christina SainUX Planet--64Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Christine VallaureinUX Planet--27HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Antón Garcia,https://medium.com/@antongd,"7, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UQygvO5FoRqMZuzlPO_4yg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HAbqmM2GI9tLJdx6uIzvHw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*D6EG1KXKMboDDED7jqBP7w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OhZjd9lo2vhnJAIbziBEFg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*lpptUdfmaC3oxM11y66RtA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*D2oaIlG3IkS1HZyRv2WDzQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1yLaQTYwIHH5exHMaPG0qQ.png",11,222
62,21988,https://medium.com/@andresanaribah/how-does-the-blockchain-work-eba72bfb8555?source=tag_archive---------115-----------------------,How Does the Blockchain Work?,None,"Andres AnaribaFollow--ListenShareBlockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and we can think of the blockchain as a database that stores a record of every movement of money between different parties.The Academic White Paper released by Satochi Nakamoto in October 31 of 2008, describes the creation of a system (the bitcoin network) that would allow people to pay each other directly, without the need for a central authority, like a Bank.One of the key characteristics of the bitcoin network was the idea of a blockchain. The Bitcoin Blockchain was a tool to store a list of monetary transactions between different people.However the only purpose of Bitcoin was to enable financial transactions.Not long after its release, many people realize that they could use some of bitcoins original innovations to not only handle the transfer of currency, but other types of exchanges as well.Vitaly Dmitriyevich “Vitalik” Buterin released a White Paper of his own in late 2013. Vitalik envisioned using blockchain technology to create far more complex applications. He described using Ethereum to create sub cryptocurrencies, domain name registration systems, and gambling applications. The Ethereum System eventually went online on July 30th of 2015.So the blockchain enables financial transactions, but what is a transaction?A transaction is a record that describes the transfer of funds from one account to another. A transaction is created anytime two accounts exchanged some amount of money.This object has a variety of different properties assigned to it.Every time we make a transaction we change the blockchain.To understand what the Blockchain is, first we have to understand a couple of concepts. The first one (and easiest one) is the Hash.The Hash is a fingerprint of some digital data. Regardless of the amount of information, no information, or a big amount of information, you’ll always get a hash with the same length. You cannot predict the data out of the hash, you would have to put the exact same data to figure out what the hash is, but you’ll always get exactly the same hash regardless of how many times you put the same information in.After understanding what the Hash is, we can go to our second concept, which is where it starts to get interesting, and this concept is the Block.A Block is exactly like the hash, is just that the Data Section is broken out into different sections. However, the hash of the block, which includes all of the block’s information should begin with four zeroes (0000). This means that the Block is signed.In this case we are using just some text as data, but in reality, data could be transactions that are being stored in this Block.Every time we change the data of the block, the hash of the block changes as well.So now we can see that the hash doesn’t start with ‘0000‘ anymore, which means that his block is not a valid or signed block, and that‘s where the nonce comes in. This nonce is just a number that we can set to try to find a number that fits so that this hash starts with ‘0000’ again. We could try and guess this nonce, but it would take us forever to get it right.So here is where mining comes in. When we mine, we are trying to make the block signed again, so basically we’re trying to get the hash of this block to start with ‘0000‘ again. In this case when we start mining, we will run through all the numbers, until we found one where the hash starts with ‘0000‘.After understanding these concepts, we can finally get into what Blockchain actually is.Blockchain is basically a chain of blocks (of course…). A difference between the block we just saw, and the blocks in the Blockchain, is that there is a “Previous“ Hash, which is (again, of course…) a copy of the hash of the previous Block.The “Previous“ Hash is stored as data on the block, which means that every time the “Previous“ Hash changes, the hash of the block where it’s stored changes as well.So, if we change the data of a block, that has one or more blocks after it, we have to mine that current Block, and all the subsequent Blocks, so they all become signed again.(Note that we don’t have to mine Block #1 because we are not changing its Data!)So, the more Blocks we are in the past, the harder it is to make a change, because we have to remine all the Blocks that come after it, and that’s how a Blockchain is going to resist change.So in this way if we were to go back in the past and change some value, it’s important that we notice it, because as we mentioned before, here our data is just some random text, but in reality this data means transactions, and transactions means money, and with money it’s very important that you don’t lose track, and that’s the whole point of resisting any kind of modifications of things that have happened in the past, and this is (among other things) what makes the Blockchain so secure.The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that it doesn’t rely on a central point of control. A lack of a single authority makes the system fairer and considerably more secure. Rather than relying on a central authority to securely transact with other users, blockchain utilizes innovative consensus protocols across a network of nodes, to validate transactions and record data in a manner that is incorruptible. As a blockchain is a ledger of information it is extremely important that the information being stored is honest and accurate.----Software Developer https://www.medium.com/famecoinAndres AnaribainFamecoin--1Andres AnaribainFamecoin--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Andres Anariba,https://medium.com/@andresanaribah,"10, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HQU3eCPnX2ED8KqOzLJqHg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*nehGxCiuMoOxbhkXYdptDg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OOfdqByGjM7UuVHDHAL0_g.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*GnHW4I5PBy07BiyewXLYvw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*XJ6hGE463L3M9aAQNbRFUw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*riSvO5DrJlylw5v0Be6aNA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*IGasoqvbHolTAUbmJJQAQg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*rvHMlDMlfDfCER33F4yuNg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*imbFQWx1_D7ypQguee9JLA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*pfuq5DTzbqBVpfRxraU60g.jpeg",5,95
65,41785,https://medium.com/nextdns/how-we-made-dns-both-fast-and-private-with-ecs-4970d70401e5?source=tag_archive---------3-----------------------,How we made DNS both fast and private with ECS,None,"Olivier PoitreyFollowNextDNS--5ListenShareTL;DR: In this article we describe why public DNS resolvers need EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) to workaround performance issue of popular services that use DNS to steer their clients to a nearby server. Then we will see that ECS can have issues with privacy and DNS cache efficiency.We will then describe our approach to benefit from ECS without having to suffer from its downsides by building a subnet substitution map and a whitelist.At NextDNS, we strive to make DNS both fast and private. A naive way to define a fast DNS is by measuring the time it takes for a DNS server to give back a response, taking into account the network latency and the server processing time.Rarely a DNS response is the information requested by the end user. Most likely, DNS is a dependency of another higher level service like HTTP. Often, those HTTP services are using DNS to steer their traffic to the closest location to their users. This technique is commonly called GeoDNS or latency based routing (depending on the source of data used).DNS steering works on the premise that DNS resolvers are provided by ISPs, and thus live on the same network within close location of the user. As all users of an ISP are potentially sharing the same set of DNS resolver caches, DNS steering provides a relatively efficient way to steer traffic to the closest location without exposing too much user privacy at the DNS level.With the growth in popularity of public DNS resolvers like Google DNS and OpenDNS in the last decade, DNS steering stopped working efficiently for the users of those resolvers. Even with faster DNS response time, those services would reply with IPs that are not close to users, making HTTP requests slower. As HTTP latency account for much more of the overall loading time than DNS, this is a bad tradeoff.In order to work around this issue, EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) was invented. This extension to the DNS protocol provides a way for the DNS resolver to release information about the client IP requesting the domain to the authoritative DNS. The full client IP is not transmitted, only a part of it called a subnet.A subnet represents one or more IPs sharing the same prefix. The smaller the prefix, the more IPs are contained in the subnet. For instance, the CIDR representation 198.51.100.0/24 represents the 256 IPs starting with 198.51.100.x while 198.51.100.0/22 represents the 1024 IPs between 198.51.100.0 and 198.51.103.255.An authoritative DNS (or auth DNS) is a DNS server used to host domain zones for which they have authority. Their clients are usually DNS cache resolvers which perform recursive DNS queries for end clients running stub resolvers.In response to a DNS query with ECS information, an authoritative DNS can choose to give a response that is valid for a subnet that is equal or larger than the subnet prefix provided. This way, the DNS resolver can cache the response for potentially more clients, improving their DNS response time. The size of the cacheable response prefix is called the scope. A scope of 0, means the queried name does not have ECS enabled and thus can be cached globally.In practice, 99% of ECS enhanced requests are performed with a /24 prefix in IPv4 and an /56 prefix in IPv6. For IPv4, a /24 is only 256 IPs. This is very narrow and can be concerning for privacy.Authoritative DNS are supposed to reply with larger scope if possible to improve cacheability, but we measured that 45% of authoritative DNS supporting ECS and giving a non-zero scope reply with a /24 scope or smaller for IPv4. With such small subnet, the cache becomes highly fragmented, and the average cache hit ratio of a DNS resolver will go from something like 85% to only 25%, and close to 0% for /24 scoped domains, substantially slowing down average DNS resolution time.For those reasons, few DNS resolvers deployed ECS. For the most part, only public resolvers like Google DNS and OpenDNS deployed it.The trend those days for newer, privacy oriented public DNS resolver seems to be ditching ECS altogether. This is the choice Cloudflare DNS and Quad9 have made for instance. Their reasoning is that with the many locations they have, their cache is sufficiently localized to offset the absence of ECS.This statement can be true if the number of Points of Presence (PoPs) of the DNS provider is higher or equal to the number of PoPs exposed by the content provider with similar locality. In the case of Cloudflare, this is probably true in most cases.Although, some large content providers like Netflix, Facebook or Google as well as CDNs like Akamai have servers hosted directly inside ISP networks. Their DNS will only steer clients to those ISP embedded servers if the IP of the resolver or the subnet provided through ECS is part of the ISP’s IP space. ECS is thus required for public DNS resolvers to benefit from those servers.The main downside of ECS is privacy and DNS cache fragmentation due to the narrow client subnet used for both query and response. We can solve those two issues by substituting client’s subnet with another subnet that would be shared by all clients from the same rough location and ISP.To achieve this, we use an aggregated BGP full table extract to associate all IP blocks with their associated ASN.An Autonomous System Number (ASN) in a nutshell is an ID attributed to a network entity (like an ISP) to abstract their network assets (like IP blocks) when communicating their routing policy.We then use a GeoIP database to split blocks by country. For large countries like USA, we further split by Metro code, which is still pretty large, but local enough to give good results. The output is a list of IP blocks is mapped to a key composed of the ASN:Country[:Metro Code]:For each keys, we randomly pick one /24 subnet from all the IP blocks sharing the same key, and create the final map that defines how to substitute an IP block with the randomly picked /24 from the same ASN:Country[:Metro Code]:This map is then used by our resolver at runtime to map client IPs to those /24:Thanks to this technique, client subnet no longer leak and all clients of a given ISP in the same rough location benefit from the same cache space. We noticed an improvement of the cache hit ratio of about 10%. This is lower than expected, but still a good improvement for privacy and tail latency.While we were analyzing the results, we found that more than 50% of the top 1 million domains (qnames to ne exact) supporting ECS are giving the same responses for subnets in very different locations. It seems like those authoritative DNS check the ECS feature checkbox, but don’t actually need it, forcing DNS resolvers supporting ECS to store duplicate copies the same result for each client subnet. We also notice that those domains are likely the one responding with a narrow ECS scope.To further improve cache hit ratio and avoid sending any kind of ECS information for domains that don’t use it to improve user experience, we decided to generate a whitelist. This whitelist is generated by selecting from the top 10 queried domains the ones that, when queried with ECS subnet from 3 different locations far from each others are:With those two solutions together, our cache hit ratio got back up to about 75%.A little known feature of NextDNS is the ability to get debug info for any query. It is a bit hacky, hence the dig parser warning. The idea is to make a CHAOS query instead of a IN one. NextDNS responds to such queries (only over TCP) with the IN class answer and some TXT debug fields in the CH class:You can see the smart-ecs TXT record shows the substituted subnet used for the client IP, which is from a totally different subnet than the client IP but from same ASN/Metro. This does also mean facebook.com is in the ECS whitelist.Now if tried with another domain:We can see that ECS isn’t sent at all. It means this domain is not whitelisted because it does not make use of the ECS information to improve user experience.----5NextDNSDirector of Engineering at Netflix (Open Connect); Co-Founder of Dailymotion; Co-Founder of NextDNS; Code addict https://github.com/rsOlivier PoitreyinNextDNS--Romain CointepasinNextDNS--9Unbecoming--767Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Olivier Poitrey,https://medium.com/@poitrus,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*SxMUv9W99h5X0V-SsGfhbg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hShzIdW4PGgvJY1oJ0nDgw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*e3OsMSWTug_p8YxY8dI2xg.png",7,64
66,50345,https://medium.com/@scriptbees/ansible-for-network-automation-configuration-management-1f45229ae341?source=tag_archive---------81-----------------------,Ansible For Network Automation & Configuration Management ,Ansible For Network Automation & Configuration Management,"ScriptBeesFollow--ListenShareWhat is AnsibleAnsible is an open-source automation platform and an IT configuration management, Deployment, and Orchestration Tool where we have to run tasks in sequence and create a chain of events that must happen on different servers or devices. The tool aims to provide substantial productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges.OverviewAnsible is simple to setup and yet powerful. Firstly, a VM created in any of the cloud-like AWS, Azure, GCP, DO (Digital Ocean) using Terraform. We can run the backend Servers like ElasticSearch, MongoDB, MYSQL, Nginx, Redis, NodeJS, and so on by Ansible.As an example, if we have a group of web servers behind a load balancer, Ansible can upgrade the web servers one at a time. Also, it will remove the current web server from the load balancer and disable it in our Monitoring stack while upgrading.Why use Ansible?With the earlier versions of Ansible, we run the scripts locally. But now, a VM will be created in the backend, and we will deploy that VM in a single server. Or if we want to run applications in a PC, we need to install SQL manually for every PC. But using Terraform scripts, we can make the installation automated commanding what, how, and when to install the required applications.SSH connection takes care of the steps to perform like installations, updates after logging in.Features of AnsibleScriptBees provide both Terraform and Ansible Scripts, where the client can use the script just with a single command. The only thing that the client should remember is the directory structure. Based on this, we can enter into the server and open mysql.yaml file used for MySQL application.The IP address will be loaded, and installation occurs at the location where it should be.Our First Test / CommandsNow that we have installed Ansible and added some hosts to the inventory file — /etc/ansible/hosts and we can try to connect to our hosts.A connection establishes by default with SSH keys, and we can also specify a Username and Password.Let us test our first command to connect to our inventory machines with the ping module.$ ansible -m ping allcontrol | SUCCESS => {“changed”: false,“ping”: “pong”}lb01 | SUCCESS => {“changed”: false,“ping”: “pong”}app02 | SUCCESS => {“changed”: false,“ping”: “pong”}app01 | SUCCESS => {“changed”: false,“ping”: “pong”}Returning Success means the control machine can run ‘ping’ command on every device in the inventory.‘all’ use for every host in inventory, and to only target host in a specific group, we choose instead.sWe can also run the ‘Is’ command as well.Now, we are set up to run commands on our inventory machines.Ansible PlaybooksThe strength of Ansible lies in its Playbooks. A playbook is like a recipe that tells Ansible what to perform on each host. Playbooks are written in YAML, viewed as XML as a human-readable manner.An Ansible command line is high for executing a single task, but Playbooks are more useful for multiple Tasks/Jobs.Create a folder named Playbooks and create a list. yaml inside with the below text— -- hosts: alltasks:- name: list files in foldercommand: lsThe above three dashes are part of the YAML formatting.Now, we can run the following command to execute our first playbook.$ ansible-playbook playbooks/list.ymlRunning Up the NodesLoad BalancerCreate a file loadbalancer.yaml with the below text.N—– hosts: load balancerbecome: truetasks:– name: install nginxapt: name=nginx state=present update_cache=yes– name: start nginxservice: name=nginx state=started enabled=yes[/cc]The playbook now will install Nginx on the Ib01 and start Nginx.If port 80 on the Ib01 machine is open, then we should be able to go to http://localhost and see the below information on the web browser.Welcome to nginx!If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required.For online documentation and support please refer to nginx.org.Commercial support is available at nginx.com.Thank you for using nginx.Running the Load BalancerInside the Playbook folder, create a template folder with the file nginx.conf.j2 with the code,upstream test {{% for server in groups.webserver %}server {{ server }};{% endfor %}}server {listen 80;location / {proxy_pass http://test;}}Also, we can update the load balancer if we want to with the corresponding update code and type the below command to run the load balancer playbook.$ ansible-playbook playbooks/loadbalancer.ymlAnd now, we should be able to connect to http://localhost, and the response should change every time we reload the page.RoleRoles are the way to load certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers automatically based on a known file structure. Grouping of content by roles also allows easy sharing with other users.Role Directory StructureA sample Project structure will looks as,site.ymlwebservers.ymlfooservers.ymlroles/common/tasks/handlers/files/templates/vars/defaults/meta/webservers/tasks/defaults/meta/Roles expect files to be in specific directory names and must include one of these directories.

Artificial intelligence is seen as the future technological advancement in the current world scenario, in today’s world we have some AI technologies but we have not fully achieved artificial intelligence yet. So how AI will change our future and how we mix this technology with our lives, these are some of the questions we all want to know.In the below article you can learn about the types of AITYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEReactive MachinesAI in initial days ways made for the reactive purpose, this type of artificial intelligence was not able to utilize its past experiences to perform the present task. Deep Blue is a chess-playing computer of IBM that defeated the international grandmaster of chess Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Reactive machine AI observes the things and reacts to that based on pre-programmed functions.Limited MemoryFrom the name itself defines that it has artificial intelligence with limited memory. In this type of AI, the system can utilize its past experiences and gain information from it, but this could be done for a short duration. This type of artificial intelligence is mainly used in autonomous cars to protect from accidents. It takes around 100 seconds for an AI to make a decision in such self drove cars.Self-AwarenessBasically this type of Artificial Intelligence has not been developed yet, we as a human does not experience self-awareness AI yet. This type of AI development can identify themselves, the machine or robots are well aware of themselves and there own functioning. So they can possess self-developed emotions from there experiences.Theory of mindThis kind of AI mainly focuses on human feelings and psychology, this benefits in understanding human reasoning and beliefs. You can say that the Theory of Mind is a higher variant of Artificial Intelligence which appreciates human conduct and feelings. This sort of AI still not exists fully in the present universes. But research shows that we are progressively heading towards such artificial intelligence.----Our company is a software development based company we provide mobile and web design and development solutions all over the world.Phontinent Technologies--Phontinent Technologies--Phontinent Technologies--Phontinent Technologies--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Phontinent Technologies,https://medium.com/,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*A1sTkukPSr19Tb0EGg5rNg.jpeg",2,0

For the first time, fans were able to track player’s movements almost instantaneously as well as see pass-run predictions based on years of previous data.Players have been wearing RFID chips from Zebra Technologies embedded in their shoulder pads in every game since 2014. However, the data has not been widely accessible until now except for coaches. Previously, Next Gen Stats had published after each game.“The NFL has been happy with the seamlessness of it, with the efficiency and accuracy,” stated Zebra Vice President John Pollard said. “It’s a new source of content in terms of adding dimensionality (to the game).”Zebra MotionWorks Sport and its patented RFID technology allow for a trove of data to be collected for real-time insight.As “The Official On-Field Player-Tracking Provider” of the NFL, Zebra is committed to supporting the league’s ongoing initiative of improving the way fans, teams and networks watch, coach, play and analyze the game using Zebra Sport Solution real-time, revolutionary player-tracking system.Fans cannot only replay any key moments but also receive alerts on their phones of any significant statistics. Additionally, before each snap, fans can see a sliding scale that will predict the likelihood of a pass or run play. This sliding scale will appear on a field diagram, and once the ball is caught, a ball icon will appear on the player’s circle.While this is just a trial, the data collected by Zebra will provide Next Gen Stats will a plethora of information that will not only prove vital to team personnel but will allow fans to engage in an entirely new and insightful way.How does Zebra MotionWorks Sport work? The RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) sensors, which in this case are embedded in a player’s shoulder pad underneath their jersey, utilize radio waves to both identify and track objects. In this case, the RDIF chip is tracking all data associated with an individual player. That information is transferred to a receiver that can process all the incoming data and output near real-time analysis. In order for this to happen, the chips need to operate on a super high frequency.The benefits for all involved can be outstanding. Not only are fans given access to real-time play data, but such an in-house-only experience will incentivize more fans to attend. Increased ticket sales will only improve team revenue and enable an even greater fan experience.For coaches, MotionWorks allows them to track an individual player’s performance. The data enables trainers to keep athletes performing at their peak by developing personalized training plans based on individual’s metrics and exhaustion limits. The training data can be synched with game day data to optimize a training plan moving forward.This type of data-forward analysis allows coaches to quickly strategize using the real-time data to make play calls in real-time. They can evaluate groupings/formations, analyze running patterns, access separations created on pass coverage as well as quarterback pressure. The possibilities are limitless.Players can also use all the data collected to analyze their play. If a player has a knee injury and is looking to make a comeback, they can track and analyze their running speed and ability both before and after the injury. The health, wellness and overall performance of each individual are monitored and stored. Such information could be critical in any athlete’s future.This type of technology will prove to be a win-win for all involved. Team and brand partnerships are essential to the growth of both organizations. Finding a purposeful partnership may take time, but it is certainly worth the wait.Stay tuned for more updates about the partnership between Zebra MotionWorks Sports and the NFL. Will the Pro-Bowl game, making all data available in real-time to all in NFL game attendance become widely available?Instant Sponsor aims to grow and enhance the sports sponsorship marketplace beginning in 2019.

My paternal great-grand parents landed in San Francisco’s North Beach from Mexico almost one hundred years ago and my family has made a home here ever since. No matter where I roam or how this gold rush city changes, San Francisco will always be my true love.Q: What is it like being a part of the Member Experience team?A: Hands-down, I’ve never worked with a better team. We are intensely hard-working. Our Member Experience Associates are insanely bright, patient and quick to help, and it shows in the consistently amazing reviews we get. But there has always got to be some time in the day just to sit with each other, laugh and talk about random things like our favorite childhood cookie brands, random grizzly bear facts and whether banana bread is a bread, a cake or a pastry. (If you join us, it’s required you take a stand on this extremely important matter. ;)Q: What has been your favorite memory with your team?A: Dressing up in a themed costume is very much the thing around here. It’s insanely fun and dorky. One of my faves has to be when we dressed up as the 1980’s cartoon “Inspector Gadget” for Halloween. We did it right — our Support Engineer was Gadget, our Customer Education Content Specialist was Dr. Claw. We even incorporated lesser known characters such as Professor Von Slickstein, Corporal Capeman and the Gadget Mobile. (Wikipedia it! These characters exist!) The team usually nails it, but this one we nailed especially well.Q: When did you know HoneyBook was the right choice?A: The moment I walked into this gorgeous office. There is a feeling about this place and the people that work here — it felt like family and home.Q: We save the most important question for last.

Jeremy is a 24 year old singer passionate about changing the world with his voice, words, and imagery yet doesn’t have the capital to hire the crew, purchase equipment, or reserve locations to professionally produce his music video. Like you and me, Jeremy is a creator.Patreon, Kickstarter and GoFundMe are just some of the companies you may have thought of that Jeremy could use to help fund his creative endeavor. The return for fans who have financially supported Jeremy through some of these crowdfunding platforms is typically either in special content, a unique product, or simple gratitude. However, none of these platforms offer any form of monetary return for the fans who have donated, funded, and supported their favorite creators for years.Now what if there was a product that would treat Jeremy less like a charity and more like a start-up. Creators are really just start-ups, after all. They offer something unique that people want to buy, they need funding to help them build it, and they need great market fit in order to succeed.“Surely somebody has thought of this before and there’s definitely a product out there that can let me invest in a content creator.” Well you’re absolutely right. Plenty of entrepreneurs have thought of ways that we could greatly help fund creators and provide monetary returns to their loyal fans. But unfortunately it’s a lot easier said than done.It’s legally, ethically, and feasibly impossible to “own” a percentage of a person, for obvious reasons. Companies are organizations that offer out shares of their revenue to the public, but they’re not monetarily tethered to individuals. So, we need an alternative solution to support creators but still be able to own a part of their content.There are products out there that allow you to buy into songs’ royalties, purchase cryptocurrency tokens, invest directly in their IP, and more, but none of them have truly broken through the competitive funding landscape and emerged as a premiere alternative to crowdfunding options. In my opinion, this is due to the high level of complexity that the current solutions operate with because it is incredibly challenging to track a content creator’s revenue:This is why platforms have tried assigning value to more tangible assets that these creators produce: specific projects, songs, royalties, IP, etc. Unfortunately, none of them have been viable competitors to the Patreon, IndieGoGo, and GoFundMe’s of the world.In a society fueled by automatization and algorithms, we’re slowly losing fans’ personal connections to content creators and their art. For example, YouTube is now centralized around their algorithmic focused back-end that has prevented countless creators from earning enough to sustain a proper living, limited the audience that they can reach, and constrained their artistic talents in order to be presentable to the masses.At Crestio, we want to change all of that. We want to build a platform that will allow fans to directly invest in a content creator’s project in exchange for a percentage of that project’s revenue. No cryptocurrency, blockchain, AI, royalties, tokens, distribution limits, or anything else that could potentially complicate this simple transaction.If the project does well, the creator and their invested fans gain monetary profit. Then, when that creator plans to release another project, their fans are already motivated to invest and the creator has piqued the interest of other potential fans as well. However if the project doesn’t do too well, the fans and the creator may have just lost their invested money. This situation is most definitely in the scope of reality, and is something that content creators and fans need to be aware of.No solution is perfect, but we believe that our platform is a powerful step in the right direction because it addresses the needs and wants from both the creator and fan’s points of view unlike any other alternative in the market. It’s going to require many hours of manual work to connect with creators and track their project’s revenue, but “What comes easy won’t last and what lasts won’t come easy”.Jeremy now opens the Crestio app on his phone, registers his music video as a project, and within a couple of days, Jeremy raises $10,000 and is now filming the music video of his dreams.First off, thank you very much for taking the time to read this article. It means a lot knowing that there are people like me who are passionate about creators, contents, and fans.If you’re interested in Crestio and being a part of the revolutionary change to the way we approach creators, feel free to check out our web landing page here:crestio.usWe plan on releasing our fully functional mobile app in the next month, so be sure to check the Apple Store and Google Play store soon.Finally, if you have any questions for myself or our team, please don’t hesitate to reach out and let us know!

But what can you do to lessen the risk of long-term effects caused by just doing your job?Allowing yourself to take small breaks throughout the day is a good start. Some of you may have even heard of the 20–20–20 rule, popularized by Dr. Jeff Anshell a specialist in “vision ergonomics”. The rule states that for every 20 minutes spent looking at the screen, a person should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain caused by looking at digital screens for an extended period of time. Many of you may have heard of blue light and its damaging effects to our vision. But what exactly is blue light?Blue light is everywhere. We get the most exposure to it from being outdoors in the daylight from the sun. However, there are many man-made devices such as computer screens, tv screens and smartphones that emit a significant amount of blue light. Though this exposure to man-made devices is not as significant as the sun, the usage frequency and proximity to these screens is what is causing long-term effects on eye health. Blue light basically penetrates to the retina (inner lining of the back of the eye) and damages its light-sensitive cells. Many health-care professionals believe that this increased exposure to blue light may lead to macular degeneration which can lead to permanent vision loss.Luckily for us, there are ways we can protect ourselves. There is tech and even emerging tech that have made solutions to these problems. Below I will list products that have been created for the sole purpose of bettering our day-to-day in the workplace by improving posture, protecting your vision and supporting your wrists.A very common app used among developers is f.lux. This app tracks your current location and synchronizes itself with the rising and setting of the sun. As day turns to night, it slowly adjusts the colors on your screen to be easier on your eyes. The blue light is taken out and what is left are the warm colors such as reds, oranges and yellows. By regulating blue light throughout the day your body will be able to produce more melatonin at night and you will fall asleep faster and deeper. Alternatives to this product are Iris, Redshift and Twilight.Price: Free download2. Blue Light GlassesAnother way to protect your eyes from blue light is by using blue light filtered eyeglasses. You do not need a prescription, though there are prescription lenses that have the blue filter as well. These glasses are meant to be worn as you are staring into a screen and should be taken off when you are not. Felix Gray eyeglasses are specifically designed to soothe weary and tired eyes and from my research, they have good reviews.Price: $95 — $1253. Time OutTime Out is an app that helps remind you to take work breaks throughout the day. It has two kinds of settings: a “Normal” break, typically for 10 minutes after 50 minutes of work, so you can move around and relax, plus a “Micro” break: a very brief pause of typically 10 seconds every 10 minutes, so you can remember not to tense up too much for long periods of time. Alternative options to Time Out are BreakTime and MacBreakz.Price: Free download4. Upright GoThis device is a strapless posture corrector that you place on your upper back. It reminds you to sit or stand up straight with a real-time gentle vibration reminder. This device is great if you need constant reminders to sit upright while doing your daily activities or if you’re zoned in at work. Upright Go uses an app that can be downloaded for either iOS or Android. There you can set the settings and calibrate your device. Lastly, the app has a personalized training plan that consists of daily goals to help strengthen your back and train your brain to be aware of slouching. Alternative to this product is Lumo Lift.Price: $79.95 — $99.955. Ergonomic KeyboardAn ergonomic keyboard is a wise investment for any person who spends his or her day working on a computer. Most people have never realized they are slowly injuring themselves each day by turning their wrists inward to fit to a flat keyboard. When users turn their wrists inward and start typing, RSI’s like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome start to develop because the wrists are put in an unnatural position throughout the entire day.Price: $89 on amazon6. Ergonomic MouseA standard computer mouse forces wrist pronation and stress on tendons, which can lead to repetitive stress injuries and long-term damage. Simply put, as humans, our wrists are not meant to twist in the way a traditional mouse requires you to do so. Most office jobs require at least eight hours each day in this position. An ergonomic mouse, such as the Anker Ergonomic Mouse, allows the user to mouse in the natural, handshake position, alleviating pain and stress injuries.Price: $19.99 on amazon----Gaida Escobar--Gaida Escobar--Gaida Escobar--2Gaida Escobar--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Gaida Escobar,https://medium.com/@gaidaescobar,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*gspu-sGtmmGiFFMdNddmjw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*sYaQy07FPh_Qlfl89J7wNg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*xqWGW0qNuQ46sdvk8a6IFQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8fWD8e5DTjhCzTxA6YJlow.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*G-y7J7BBrH1UIAuxERZGWg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*tCK3ZrRZLmuBWRrWMTmjGA.jpeg",5,701
76,3399,https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/what-is-bitcoin-92eca7a02578?source=tag_archive---------94-----------------------,What is Bitcoin?,None,"Michael GreenwoodFollowDigital Diplomacy--1ListenShareThe last few years have seen the exponential rise of a new kind of currency called Bitcoin. It has been the buzz that has spawned a whole new global FinTech industry. It is finding new applications in a broad array of fields and new revolutionary technologies are being developed around the original Bitcoin concept. But what exactly is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and payment network that allows users to pay each other directly or exchange value without the involvement of a trusted third party. It is based on a decentralized public ledger called blockchain which provides the crypto proof for the transactions. It was created in 2009 by a person or groups of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.Traditionally, payment systems have always relied on trusted third parties or intermediaries. They are systems that rely on trust to make them work and this trust is always provided through centralized control. A good example is the central bank or commercial banks. If you are holding a fiat currency such as the US dollar, you must rely on the Federal Reserve not to debase the currency. Likewise, you must trust commercial banks with your private information and trust them to provide excellent security systems that will protect your identity and your money. It is often the case that the trust is misplaced.The centralized control is the same mechanism through which card processing companies such as VISA and MasterCard process payments across the globe. The magic with Bitcoin is that it is not centralized and it does not require an Issuing Bank or government fiat to guarantee value. It is a currency in itself that allows users to exchange value with one another without any intermediary. Unlike credit or fiat currencies such as the Euro or the US Dollar, Bitcoin is not backed with anything. It is neither backed by a gold standard or a government fiat. Instead, it derives its value almost out of nowhere through a complex computing algorithm that makes the underlying technology virtually impossible to counterfeit. In place of centralized control, it relies on a public ledger called blockchain and a network of nodes or computers to validate transactions.What is Blockchain?Bitcoin is built on a technology called blockchain which was invented in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional financial institutions that maintain private ledgers of transactions, the Bitcoin blockchain system maintains a transparent public ledger of all transaction records. This ledger is distributed across all the nodes in the network. Currently, there are more than 9500 Bitcoin nodes or computers in the network so the Bitcoin public ledger or blockchain is uniformly available in all of these computers. It is therefore virtually indestructible. This makes it a trustless system.The peer-to-peer design of the blockchain is what makes the system completely autonomous. It is outside the control or jurisdiction of any government.All the transactions, activities as well as the balances in the Bitcoin network are stored in the shared public ledger and these transactions are verified by thousands of computers (or nodes) that are connected to the network. These nodes eliminate the need for a middleman in Bitcoin transactions. As long as you have the internet and Bitcoin in your wallet, you can send money to anyone anywhere in the world.In popular online literature, Bitcoin “coins” are represented as small golden coins with a B-sign engraving. In reality, a Bitcoin is simply an entry or a record on the blockchain ledger. The blockchain ledger tracks all the transactions and tracks who owns what. It contains the transaction history of all the 16.4 million bitcoins in circulation.When you transfer your Bitcoin to another party, those Bitcoins will make up a new block of transactions. The new blocks are stacked onto the blockchain after every 10 minutes or so. There is no central regulator validating or approving blocks. Instead, what you have is a network of tens of thousands of users on the blockchain network who authenticate the transactions and keep the system running. These users are called Bitcoin miners.There is a predetermined number of Bitcoins of 21 million. Out of these, 16.4 million have already been mined or unlocked and are in circulation. The difficulty level of mining Bitcoins is increasing by the day so users will have to expend a lot more energy to unlock the remaining Bitcoins. The last block of Bitcoins will be mined in 2140.What is Bitcoin Mining?Bitcoin mining is the process through new Bitcoins are created in the blockchain. Every time there is a Bitcoin transaction, this transaction will be recorded and then verified in the decentralized Bitcoin public ledger called the blockchain.Currently, there are more than 9500 people using their computers to maintain similar records of these transactions. These people or nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin blockchain system. Because the Bitcoin records are stored in so many computers, it is virtually impossible for someone to hack into the Bitcoin blockchain and manipulate or falsify the record of transactions in all the nodes. This bestows the Bitcoin blockchain with immutability. The public records on blockchain are unalterable and permanent.During Bitcoin mining, the computers that make part of the Bitcoin blockchain record and verify the information on transactions that are queued on the blockchain. These miners run software that validates blocks of bitcoin transactions. The miners must reach a consensus on what the latest updates to the blockchain should look like. The nodes know the origin of the transactions and the “fakes” are rejected.In the Bitcoin blockchain, this process of verification entails the solving of complex cryptographic puzzles and requires significant computing power. The complex cryptographic puzzles are aimed at verifying whether the person spending the Bitcoins actually owns them and that the person cannot spend the coins twice (the double spending problem).The people who dedicate their computing power to solving these cryptographic puzzles earn a reward in the form of transaction fees or virgin coins. The transaction fees are paid by Bitcoin users when they send coins. The virgin coins are earned by Bitcoin miners who are the first to solve the math problem in the Bitcoin blockchain. They amount to 12.5 Bitcoins. At the current exchange rate, that is equivalent to $102, 610!How do you pay using Bitcoin?To start using Bitcoins, you need what is called a Bitcoin wallet. This is just an application on your computer or your phone that you use to keep track of all the bitcoins that you currently hold. The Bitcoin wallet allows you to spend your bitcoins either through a QR code or by keying in the recipient’s bitcoin wallet address. It’s a direct peer-to-peer transfer without any intermediaries.What is a Bitcoin Wallet?A wallet is a secure storage service for your bitcoins and you are fully responsible for its security. You have to create and remember a strong password that you will use to gain access to your bitcoins. It is also prudent that you create a backup for the records or transactions that are stored in your bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin is a fully decentralized system so if your coins are stolen, there is really no way of reversing the transactions. It is like losing cash on the highway.Some of the most popular Bitcoin wallets include the following:- Bitcoin Core: You can find it at www.bitcoin.org. It is a desktop wallet and was the original Bitcoin wallet and gives users control of both their public and private keys. BitcoinArmory.com: Armory is an open source desktop wallet that offers users a Multi Signature Support and Cold Storage support. Blockchain.info: Unlike the above two, blockchain.info is an online web-based Bitcoin wallet. It is currently the most popular Bitcoin wallet with more than 8 million wallets. BitGo.com: This is another top online Bitcoin wallet with excellent security features. KeepKey.com: KeepKey is a hardware wallet. It gives you complete control over your BTC and is an ideal option if you have a large amount of Bitcoin and need an unhackable storage solution.BitcoinTrezor.com: This is another popular Bitcoin hardware wallet that has been recommended by some of the top Bitcoin users.----1Digital DiplomacyPassionate creator on a mission to build a better tomorrow to interact with.Michael GreenwoodinGood Audience--Matthias LüfkensinDigital Diplomacy--Nicolas CarteroninDigital Diplomacy--3Michael GreenwoodinGood Audience--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Michael Greenwood,https://medium.com/@mgcreativefactor,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-VtIsOy6qsjZC_CDN4MtAw.jpeg",6,5

They covered a lot in their 20 minute conversation. Below are highlights, broken into segments, with links to further reading.JEREMY (18 min. mark): “The future of finance looks more like internet marketplaces that we know today. The Amazon marketplace, the Alibaba marketplace, the Google AdWords marketplace that have incredibly long tails, that support market participants of any size-from an individual who needs capital to a small business that’s raising capital to people who at the individual level want to save and invest. And that can be driven through electronic marketplaces that exist entirely on the internet and where all that’s executed in code using this kind of infrastructure. Ultimately, that’s what we’re interested in: building these multi-sided marketplaces for capital, where there’s a supply-side of that which is these tokenized forms of securities…and there’s a demand side of that which is ultimately hundreds of millions if not billions of people who use these digital wallets to save, invest, etc.”SEAN (19 min. mark): “That’s where the web analogies breakdown; the web of content is largely unregulated and this is clearly a heavily regulated industry. When we talk about moving trust relationships into code and into software, how do we do that in a safe way for investors? How do we police financial crimes? How do we encode that in a system? That’s something we’re all still grappling with. And the guidance is very different in the United States say versus European countries versus what’s happening in Asia. As this is a global effort, that makes it very complicated to navigate. We work very closely with regulators, we work very closely with government partners around the world to try to help bring crisp guidance because that’s ultimately what we’re looking for, is to understand what really is the guidance and how do we innovate and move this forward in a way that’s beneficial to everyone and yet safe for everyone.”Further reading:SEAN (12 min. mark): “Ultimately, we’d like to build more interesting, higher-level products and services that leverage stablecoins; so whether you’re raising capital, whether you’re lending money, whether you’re investing in some form, it makes sense to have some price-stable, but globally distributed token to be able to use for those things…Ultimately, we don’t see any business model at all in payments, in as much as money is just data that should be distributed on the internet- the internet tends to want to make transmission of data free…If money is another type of content on the internet, then the simple transmission of that money should go to zero.”JEREMY (8 min. mark): “CENTRE, which we initially formed with Coinbase…but is now open to other fintech companies, financial institutions that want to become issuers of stablecoins on the CENTRE network. Really critical is we don’t believe that fiat money, in digital currency form, should be from a single company, it should be a standard that lots of companies implement and then have those fiat currency tokens be fungible and interoperable with each other. And so if Fintech A is an issuer of stablecoins then Fintech B or Bank B you should be able to redeem those with them…it should all flow freely across those..our approach is it’s an open standard, it’s an open-source project, it’s a governance scheme that deals with things like compliance, legal, regulatory issues with issuing these types of stablecoins…Our view is that stablecoins need to exist across many different blockchains. You can think of blockchains as a little bit like operating systems…they’re decentralized operating systems…and there’s an incredibly diverse range of those emerging…You don’t want to have a stablecoin model that’s tied to one blockchain, it’s sort of like saying you can only browse the web using Windows…The sort of openness of the approach, the openness of the consortium model, the open architectures, is certainly a significant difference from anything out there today.”Further reading:JEREMY (14 min. mark): “We need to work with significant banks. Banks want to grow their Assets Under Management (AUM) because that’s their fundamental business model…The advent of stablecoins creates opportunities for the banks that are really focused on growing their AUM, it creates tremendous opportunity as you go from what is currently billions of dollar value in AUM to as you have stablecoins proliferate…potentially hundreds of billions or eventually trillions of dollars. So it’s a huge opportunity for banks ultimately as well.”JEREMY (3 min. mark): “One of the fundamental issues then…was that the expectations for what you could do with the web, for example back in the late 90s, was really not connected to reality. Like the actual what you could do with these products and services you were building, the internet was really slow, there was no broadband, there were no mobile devices, there was a lot of expectation but not a lot of delivery….but then people kept building and infrastructure got better and real business could be built…in the crypto space it’s a little bit similar in that you had a lot of excitement, people saw a new way to form capital to access these trading markets, obviously a lot of problematic projects in there, too…now you’re seeing…an incredibly large number of teams were executing really compelling next gen technologies in the space and it was just everywhere. If you were close to the space you could see that the innovation curve was actually accelerating. People started to realise that and that has ultimately brought not just existing long conviction in the space back in, but I think just now starting to bring in a new range of investors.” (5 minutes)SEAN (6 min. mark): “When Amazon was built HTTP existed, TCIP existed, the infrastructure was there. Bezos and team didn’t need to build the web in order to build that. To some degree, some of the products and services that we’re looking at building on top of crypto it’s almost as if we’re building the equivalent of a global system…while we’re still figuring out the infrastructure…it’s as if HTTP isn’t quite there yet to be able to support such things. We realize that we need to invest in the development of this infrastructure.Originally published at https://blog.circle.com on June 28, 2019.----Circle blogDedicated to bringing you the latest and greatest from Circle.Circle TeaminCircle blog--Circle TeaminCircle blog--Joao ReginattoinCircle blog--Circle TeaminCircle blog--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Circle Team,https://medium.com/@CircleTeam,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1ZQhrVjzm09D41Y7XGXaCA.jpeg",5,102

But yet, we have passed that stage.Why?I have explained it for complete Blockchain Nerds — a kindergarten Blockchain orientation you will ever live to remember.The spotlight is that we are now in the era of its pure application — The Blockchain Technology on Projects.It is not a surprise that the growth of cryptocurrencies has led to enormous innovations in the Blockchain proffering solutions to so many industries.Having already analyzed an overview of over 25 startups that have proven the worth of the Blockchain technology (explained), I can say that the Blockchain will transform every industry that embraces it.The latest news now is that South Korea is coming back to adopt cryptocurrencies, and China having banned crypto trading in late 2017 thinks the Blockchain has a great feature application to different industries.Now, let me ask you.What has been your stand?Perhaps, you may want to ask what’s is so special about the Blockchain that we haven’t had an already laid down solution.The answer to the question is, are we satisfied with the current situation we are in, in terms of cybersecurity, data breaches, patent protection, transit, health Medicare and etc.?Before you answer. This is what a true Blockchain believer had to say “Consider how cybersecurity institutes are struggling to fight cybercrime such as skimming, Bitcoin exchange heists and etc.Just of recent, a small Korean exchange was hacked with millions of dollars lost which many believed affected the price of Bitcoin.Also, think about how the data protection analysis of the Europe through the GDPR process rose from 20 million to 200 Million participants”.The question still hangs on you, do you think we need a technology like a Blockchain to fight all the aforementioned challenges?Going further, while I will try to avoid taking sides here, the eye-opening awareness is that the growth of Blockchain Technology has made it possible for the many markets to blossom with so much strides.For an example, Blockchain technology of Blockpass has affected the crypto market shift positively because a lot of people see it as a great fit investing in the project.Blockpass’s role: Blockpass offers shared regulatory compliance services for humans, companies, objects and devices. As an identity system that supports verification of humans (KYC), objects (KYO) and connected devices (KYD), Blockpass will enable the development of new applications that rely on a trusted connection between multiple entities.• The Nano Vision Blockchain project is empowering global citizens to step up and lend their efforts to furthering disease-prevention research and development.• The Lisk Blockchain project is helping crypto tools to be built.So, you see, all these Blockchain projects are proffering solutions our USED-TO systems have been lacking for a long time now.Look at this.Would you consider MasterCard Company (partnering) to be founded on a Blockchain tech (for her customer’s data protection) if it weren’t important or the normal security systems already on ground is good enough? I doubt it in a grand style.Now, for instance, if considering the privacy protection of my data, all I need to do is integrate SelfKey.SelfKey is a Blockchain tech that offers users, organizations, and individuals complete control of their identity through a blockchain-based system that stores a user’s data and documents locally on their own devices.The Growth of Blockchain Technology in many countries can only be accepted by data proofs because they are enormous.In fact, a high-profile EU Blockchain initiative, the EU Blockchain Observatory Forum, was launched by the European Commission in February this year, with most comprehensive repositories of Blockchain experience and expertise.Also, in Germany, most citizens believe that investing in Blockchain Technology is one of the preferred investments.In Holland, Blockchain has recently come to force industries out in the Dutch context such that a major National Blockchain Research agenda had to be commissioned earlier in June 2018.And lastly in South Africa, the first Bitcoin ATM was recently installed for crypto users to appreciate the beauty of the blockchain market.With those established, today, I shall be using a live case study and data on the Growth of Blockchain Technology. From this study, I will feature what different tech-prenuers, crypto-millionaires think of the Blockchain technology, and many Fintech industries and countries getting involved in 2018 and beyond.Note, any indication of change about the following Blockchain projects means the list is subject to change.Walmart has embraced the Blockchain technology for its Live Food Business.This is what the Vice President of the company had to say after an official declaration on 23rd April 2018.“The Blockchain was able to shorten the time it took to track produce from six days to two seconds”Data Source: Cointelgraph.com“World‘s largest crypto exchange Binance invests in Blockchain-based E-sports platform”.The World‘s largest crypto exchange Binance has made an undisclosed investment into Blockchain-based E-sports platform Chiliz.[caption id=”attachment_1806"" align=”alignnone” width=”186""]@ Chiliz[/caption]Speaking of the investment, the Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, commented that Chiliz is a “creative way to embrace Blockchain technology” that aims to promote “Mainstream adoption”.Data Source: Chiliz’s Blog.The United Arab Emirate largest Bank — NBD wants to implement the Blockchain technology to check fraud.From the case study, the Bank believes that the Blockchain will be a major solution to check fraud in the UAE.Data Source: Cointelegraph.A Singapore-based crypto-finance company FUSION has secured $12.3 billion in financial assets.Those assets are said to be locked in the startups’ public Blockchain platform.Data Source: Computable.nl on May 31.“Software multinational company announces a launch of cloud Blockchain platform”.The Multinational Software Company SAP has launched a Blockchain-as-a-service platform called SAP Leonardo Blockchain.The company notes that the new Blockchain service will support Hyperledger Fabric and Multichain, and will be built on top of SAP’s SAP HANA data management system.Data Source: News.sap.com dated June 6.A cloud-based supply chain company known as Tradeshift said it would push Blockchain Development with money it received from its latest funding round.The series E-funding round, which included Goldman Sachs amongst its major contributors totaling $400,000,000 said that every progress would be made to kick-start the Blockchain initiative.Data Source: CoinTelegraph.‘Chinese Google’ Baidu to release interstellar Blockchain Game.The Chinese search engine Baidu has created a Blockchain-based game called “DU Yuzhou”, meaning the Universe where users will receive” elements” to build their own planets while using the Blockchain features.Data Source: Coindesk.com dated Friday, June 8.The Dutch securities marketplace and stock exchange Deutsche Borse will be spending €270 Mln, around $325 Mln on new tech investments including Blockchain.Data Source: Finextra.comPaxos, an American financial technology startup known as itBit, has attracted $65,000,000 from investors, including venture capital firms.Paxos reportedly aims to use the raised funds to bolster its operations, such as providing a blockchain-based service to financial institutions and to operate digital currency exchange and custodian itBit.Data Source: Reuters.com on May 31.After being inundated by client requests, Goldman Sachs’ has reported that they would soon open a trading desk for Bitcoin (BTC) contracts.As at April 2018, Goldman Sachs hired a crypto trader Jason Schmidt as VP of digital asset markets in their securities division to help clients work with cryptocurrencies.Data Source: CoinTelegraph.New Word: inundated — overwhelm (someone) with things or people to be dealt with.“The Moscow Exchange prepares Infrastructure to conduct Blockchain project”.The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) is preparing infrastructure that will allow companies to conduct Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which it expects to launch this year.“Right now we’re looking at this from the point of view of fiat currencies because cryptocurrencies don’t have the status of legally protected assets.If they obtain that status, we will place them in our system as well” — MOEX CEO Alexander Afanasiev.Data Source: Reuters.com.”Alipay’s parent company secures $14 Bln for Blockchain development”.Alipay’s operator Ant International has entered into “definitive agreements” with investors to secure $14 Bln in a series C equity round.

The question is, what do you make of it?Do tell me what you think below, but this is what I think. As far as these world power countries have adopted Blockchain Technology, are we then to say no, or consider it a worthless project when Billions of Dollars has already been poured into it?Be it as it may. I am happy that the amount of women considering an investment in cryptocurrencies has gone from 6% to 13%.So, at least, if you don’t trust all the above companies/startups, Blockchain actors, Fintech industries, you can at least agree to be led like a sheep by the crypto women.Power to the crypto women!Alright, as never before. I took our time to make this worthwhile in order for you to see the true picture of how far the Blockchain Technology application by adoption has gone.So, I just believe you have learned one or two, or even more things from this Case Study on the Growth of Blockchain Technology.Great, you have seen what the Growth of Blockchain Technology and its application by adoption, the question now is, what great limitation do you foresee, if none, would you get involved if you had the incentive (money) to?Give yourself a pat on the back if you now understand this subject by commenting below.Did this article make sense to you?

How do you augment yourself to stay economically relevant?,None,"Elaine BianFollow--ListenShareIn this article, I would like to envisage briefly with you together on how our near future, the next 30 years is going to be potentially shaped by the recent technological sweep in general, then zoom in to the design and innovation industry that I am aspired to go for after school.I recently wrote an article about the 6th big issue that we are facing besides Climate Change, Water Scarcity, Inequality, Urbanization and Global Health. I named it ‘Technological Sweep’.History gave us a macro picture of how phenomenal evolution of technology geared the society towards prosperous, but the disconcerting issues caused by both unintentionally and intentionally development or adoption of technology shall also be mindful as we are moving towards a new era. One of which stands out for me has been disruptive transformation of employment, not only do I refer to the irreversible trend that the repetitive labor-intensive jobs are going to be replaced by automated power including AI and robots, but also it is not outrageous to imagine and reform a radically different definition and concept of employment as we are going to live in a society together with artificial intelligence of all kinds with a certain level of intuition of humankind. As a recent paper from Mckinsey forecasted, 60 percent of occupations have at least 30 percent of constituent work activities that could be automated by 2030, it is time for leaders from all sectors to think about how society should prepare itself at all dimensions.To be able to extend a flavor of this intelligent realm that I am going to depict, let’s take a look quickly at what are the ‘superpowers’ on the plate that, with their being more advanced, are going to unleash great potentials to economics alongside redefining occupations in the process.Deep-learning AI enables us to mine massive amounts of data in real-time and to use those insights to dramatically accelerate academic discovery and create entirely new business models.The IoT (Internet of Things) connects the physical and digital worlds, bringing technology into every dimension of human progress.Robots physically and intelligently interacts with the world that are capable of carrying out complex series of actions autonomously and intuitively with the empowerment of AI.Thanks to the massive computing power, each of these capabilities is transformative in its own, but together they unlock game-changing opportunities that have not been available to us until this moment in history. And we are just beginning to tap into their full potential.Here are some assumptions moving forward,- We will, in this article not consider the potential trade-offs that business may balance between adopting technology and societal employment picture- We may put forward ideas that may have not realized yet. We do not intend to verify them nor make it a research paper, but deliberating ideas that can be further discussed- We are going to look at more or less 30 years span, where AI and robotics will be closely evolved to intuitive levelRe-imagine Design and InnovationIn general, the design and innovation firms harness human centered design to help business and society transform at scale with exceptional creativity in design and technology application of all forms. With its nature of standing in the forefront of humanity and technology, it is both exciting and full of uncertainty as we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, in the sense thatFirst, the human society that we are used to living in may no longer be just human anymore, that gives an extended invitation to rethink about the definition of ‘human’ centered designSecond, technological innovation and intervention may rely on technology itself with AI driven robots and IoT talking to each other, projecting or prototyping (virtually or physically) the optimal possible outcomes.Last but not least, the tendency that almost all the informed design decision may be highly relied and dependent on intelligent information processor with which human will have heavy direct or indirect interactionStrategist/ Business DesignerI am very much aspired to become a Strategist/Business Designer in Design and Innovation industry, not only because it sits in the intersection of business, design and technology, but also I believe that business should be designed and managed around people to better serve the society as it should be.To discuss further about how robots may intervene into my day to day work, I would like to familiarize you with how the day to day look like now for a Strategist in Design Innovation firm.Here under is what I quoted and summarized from Frog Design“Strategists establishes the frameworks that will guide the outcome. They work closely with designers and technologists to inject strategic considerations into each step of a client initiative.”From which the skillsets that a Strategist should harness profoundly well are,a. Understanding people — uncovering user needs and perceiving emerging user behaviorsb. Understanding business — helping our clients find new opportunities for market growth based on industry and market trendsc. Understanding technology — knowledgeable and curious about new technologies, and being able to see them from fresh and user-oriented perspectiveWell, it all comes down to the ability to be strategically empathetic and creative in light of the interpretation of accessible information.Now, with the penetration of artificial intelligence into my work, business and omni-present in our lives, what we can imagine in the near future is a hyper-connected and automated world where human intelligence and artificial intelligence symbiose.I can imagine myself to be working with real-time and huge amount of data to enter behavior, business and social goals as well as other parameters and ask the AI system to design possible solution frameworks that overcomes anticipated issues like confirmation bias, the empathy gap, business transformation, healthcare reform. I can imagine part of my competitive advantages will be gearing towards the ability to work with artificial intelligence and make the optimal informed decision which is something I believe will be dictated by human intelligence. However, I can still clearly see there are 2 obvious gaps here to be filled in that would augment me.a. The media that human interacts with artificial intelligence are still going through our visual and auditory system and transmit to processed by our neuro nets, which limits human ability to take advantage of and understand artificial intelligence if we go beyond. What if, I can connect myself to artificial intelligence seamlessly bypassing visual and auditory system, which would greatly augment myself in the way that I will be able to load, process the outcome from AI 10X faster and more accurate and interact with them in an unprecedented way.b. As AI is intrusively entering our lives, our decision and even behavior are getting more and more integrated with AI. Thus, I would augment myself with the ability not only being ‘human centered’ but taking human and their ‘closest AI’ into consideration as a whole when designing business solution which is something that AI has not been reachedWith that being said, I would start to augment myself by changing the job description“Strategists connect to artificial intelligence to deeply comprehend and process the viable options and make optimal informed frameworks and business proposal by adopting the new ‘human centered’ approach. They work seamlessly with artificial intelligence, designers and technologist to inject strategic consideration into each step of a client initiative.”Does it sound like a job in the future?All in all, artificial intelligence would be the great thing that is coming to our lives which would complement human intelligence in all forms and be part of the society. I choose to augment myself by not suppressing them, but symbiosing with them at all levels.----Elaine Bian--Elaine Bian----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Elaine Bian,https://medium.com/@elainebian,0,5,20

In Saudi Arabia, the health care market is estimated to grow 12.3% by 2020 reaching US$ 71.2 billion.It is inescapable that health care is indeed a business, and a behemoth revenue stream at it too. And hereon rolls the grand question — why should you care?If the rapid rise of businesses promoting a healthier lifestyle is any indication of recent years’ global trends, then health care is as you may have guessed, a global cause for concern. For many, unfortunately, the prospects of deteriorating health are often blindsided resulting in unforeseen expenses and in most cases, high costs. Then follows the challenges that emerge with financing and the unruly mental burden.Medical advancement is a double-edged sword. Scaling new heights in health care science, technology-driven facilities, quality treatment and cure and to a greater extent, Artificial Intelligence (AI), could also translate into a ballooning cost and competition structure. Not to mention, the current lack of available transparency with patient data and records in the face of a traditional medical system.Today, Saudi Arabia is experiencing a steady increase in the number of aging population and one can already anticipate an even greater need for increased efficiency, accessibility and affordability. Maneuvering the health care system — government or private — is a manual process, recurrently tedious.Well, where then might one find the most befitting health care financing plan, that provides reliable structure and able to locate the best suited doctor, in addition to transparency?Enter health care blockchain.Countering the lack of transparency and organization in patients’ health records, the purpose of the blockchain is to provide a secure and private platform to amass one’s medical data historically and in real-time. The era of fragmented patients records are to be bygones.This peer-to-peer network also lends itself to create an affordable and cost-saving mechanism and impact for health care cost in the long-term. How does it work? By converting real money into cryptocurrency, patients receive boosts in trade-in value with medical treatments within a supported network of hospitals and doctors. Its centralized format is an optimization of what originally was an inflated cost structure, and is the collective and direct result of “investments” from virtual peers.Our solution?Enter SihaToken, the first health token in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA).Founded by its parent company Sihatech — a Saudi Arabia-based tech company backed by Saudi Aramco Entrepreneurship Center and Waseel Application Service Provider — SihaToken brings an element of affordability to health care, providing an alternative to rising costs of medical inflation, and is a solution to invest in elective health care treatments that can be redeemed on-demand or financed across time to ease the burden on patients.Patients will benefit from this health care decentralization beyond traditional measures and by harnessing the power of blockchain, will be able to securely access health care of top medical facilities. This will aid both locals and expatriates within the region and beyond, further empowering our nations to advance in parallel with Vision 2030.SihaToken will be launching with a defining edge versus the commonplace. First, above-mentioned as the brainchild of one of Saudi Arabia’s most promising tech companies, we will scale with backing from a trusted and fully operating ecosystem. Second, SihaToken is arriving at a period when stability is valued most, particularly in the current teetering global economy climate. Third, SihaToken will take the “glocal” approach — global standards to meet local needs with the Islamic insurance concept, Takaful.So why is this multi-trillion dollar industry your business, you ask?A key takeaway is that health care, if not planned conscientiously could ultimately cost you, your family and your next generation inflated loans and unnecessary debt. It is a multi-faceted business that can both heal and harm. As a patient it is a birthright to concede with the most competent approach in your medical journey — and SihaToken is your vehicle.*Don’t worry, we hate spams too — we will share only important news.----SihaTokenThe first health token in the Middle East and North Africa region.SihaTokeninSihaToken--SihaTokeninSihaToken--SihaTokeninSihaToken--SihaTokeninSihaToken--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",SihaToken,https://medium.com/@sihatoken,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*RqgqQuCxpTGJnuomBUYHvg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*AVA2mosf3k5eKn5vGXshKw.jpeg",4,0

Let’s get to it.The latest trend in new sports venues and facilities is clear if you take a look at what’s popping up across the country. Gone are the days of a stadium with only a giant parking lot surrounding it. Today’s stadiums and arenas are the focal point of huge mixed-use developments, complete with hotels, restaurants, shops, and more.Teams and their owners are getting more involved in venue development, putting up more money than in decades past, partially due to the difficulty of getting city taxpayers to help pay for a shiny, expensive stadium. Another reason is so the ownership group is able to develop an entertainment destination that attracts visitors year-round, even when there isn’t an event.Today’s fan wants more out of their visit than watching a game, and mixed-use developments create all-day entertainment destinations. For a prime example, look no further than Atlanta, where you can find one of the nation’s most successful mixed-use models (suprisingly, it’s not Mercedes-Benz Stadium).The Atlanta Braves are the majority owner of their ballpark’s surrounding entertainment district, known as Battery Atlanta, that includes a nine-story office building, 350,000 sq. ft. of retail/restaurant space (soon-to-be home to 60 restaurants), a 264-room Omni Hotel, a 550-unit apartment complex, and a 3,500-seat theater. With these multi-use projects come new opportunities for team owners, opening up their potential audience from pure sports fans to a much wider swath of .Other examples of these complexes/districts include Arlington Entertainment District in Texas, The Star in Frisco (HQ of the Dallas Cowboys), the soon-to-be Chase Center in San Francisco, and the privately-funded LA Stadium & Entertainment District project (Five billion dollar price tag).Entertainment is certainly accounted for, but what about a profit for the county it’s located in? Georgia Tech’s Enterprise Innovation Institute did an economic impact analysis, calculating a net of $18.9 million per year over 20 years. What makes that number even more significant is that SunTrust Park’s revenue falls short of the operating costs by about $7.4 million per year — so the revenue earned by Battery Atlanta covers the costs and exceeds them by about $12 million.The mixed-use development model has proven successful in a number of cities, sparking several other developments currently in the planning stages. The people will come and the money will pour in…even when a game isn’t being played.Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE) has announced the addition of another payment option inside the home of the NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals. This isn’t a method you’ve seen in other sports venues as Capital One Arena is the first sports venue in the world to allow Alipay, a third-party mobile payment platform owned by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.The deal is a part of a 2018 partnership between MSE and Alibaba that also included branding and an exhibition game between the Wizards and the Guangzhou Long-Lions.MSE believes Alipay will benefit all fans as it provides another option to quickly and easily pay for concessions or merch, but they also recognize the potential to connect with a global audience in the area. Alipay serves over one billion users and a recent study by PWC states that 60% of Chinese tourists used Alipay for payments overseas in 2018.There’s no telling how many venue visitors will use Alipay going forward, but MSE and Alibaba didn’t want to miss out on a opportunity they noticed before anyone else.Before the beer and wine starts to flow at University of Minnesota basketball and hockey games, it’s got to be approved by the Board the Regents, but UMN President Eric Kaler is hopeful that the measure will pass. Minnesota Athletics brass have seen the increased revenue and an increased attendance enjoyed by other schools across the country, professional teams in the area, and even their own TCF Bank Stadium due to alcohol sales for all fans (of legal drinking age) and not only those in premium suites.Only a decade ago, beer and wine were being offered by less than a dozen schools. Yes, less than a dozen. Now, more than 50 of the 130 D1 football schools allow beer and wine sales at stadiums. And in addition to that, the NCAA now allows alcohol sales at championship events, which was experienced by fans for the first time at this year’s Final Four in Minneapolis. If the regulating organization for collegiate sports allows it at their championship events, their member institutions should be able to partake too.As the sports & entertainment landscape continues to evolve, colleges are constantly competing with other entertainment options for customers and the gap is only getting wider as today’s fans seek a social experience in addition to a game. Cities that have professional teams make the challenge even tougher for those schools. Alcohol sales will give them a better opportunity to attract a larger crowd while making a little extra cash.No, this isn’t another to-be-defunct league like the AFL. Heck, it’s not even the same football. This is Sunday men’s league football in London, where some of the footballers are just hoping their hangover doesn’t kick in before kickoff.But the real story isn’t about the play, it’s about the surrounding YouTube stardom and the fans who cheer for teams composed of mostly amateurs and average Joe’s. While the numbers aren’t huge for every team hoping to be seen and to become good enough to join a semi-pro league, Hashtag United has set the standard. HUFC is a semi-pro team in the 10th tier of English football and play in a 4,000 seat stadium, but they boast nearly four times more YouTube subscribers than local Premier League club Everton. Four times more.To put that into perspective for those on this side of the pond, the MLS has nearly 483,000 subscribers. One grassroots-turned-semi-pro team in England has nearly the same amount. That says something about the connection the athletes have with their fans via social media and how they’ve brought an exciting fan experience to a Sunday men’s league. The XFL, BIG3, or any other league trying to gain a following — take notes.Check out the full article here.

Knowledge is our best defense.,Strengthening democracy in the digital age: Knight’s $50 million investment in a new field of…,"Sam GillFollowTrust, Media and Democracy--ListenShareOn November 3, 2019, Knight made a $3.5 million investment in research to inform the national debate on internet governance and policy. Sam Gill, vice president of communities and impact at Knight, shares details below.The impact of digital technologies on American democracy continues to vex policymakers, corporate players and the public at the most fundamental level.In the past month, Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by Congress about Facebook’s decision to allow factually false claims in political advertising. California passed a law requiring the internet companies underpinning the “gig economy” to treat workers as full employees rather than independent contractors. The message board 8chan-a notorious forum for extremist content-had its servers shut down after the tragic summer shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. And a tweet from an NBA executive on the protests in Hong Kong sparked a global firestorm over whether China could determine American free speech policy.Over the summer, Congress conducted a series of hearings on issues including antitrust and competition, the legal immunity accorded to technology platforms for content they host (a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act), and the role of technology companies in managing and potentially combating online hate speech. Federal agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have launched investigations into the competitive and business practices of several technology companies. All 50 state attorneys general have initiated an antitrust investigation into Google, and 47 have joined a similar investigation of Facebook.“The impact of digital technologies on American democracy continues to vex policymakers, corporate players and the public at the most fundamental level.”The battle for the future of the internet is now joined. This digital future will no longer be determined solely by a few companies and their investors. Now, the whole of our society is in on the discussion. And the next several years are likely to be decisive in shaping a generation of regulation-both by government and involving self-regulatory action by companies-as well as defining for how our broader democratic society thinks about its relationship to these powerful and revelatory technologies.The questions that we will confront-whether as citizens and consumers, policymakers or technology executives-are procedural and foundational. The procedural questions involve how to fairly manage competing interests: an individual’s right to privacy versus a company’s business interests in collecting and using data about them; the individual right to free speech versus the rights of an online community to have standards of conduct; an individual’s right to enter a market versus the right of an incumbent to prevent competitive threats; and so on.These conversations will also be foundational. The problem is not just that we lack transparent procedures for realizing our values when it comes to the role of new technology, we also lack consensus on the underlying values themselves. Should a company like Facebook be able to host the majority of “public” conversation in the digital age? Should it be able to do so without any responsibility for what its users are saying or doing? Should we allow business models that eviscerate the competitiveness of other community goods, such as local news? Should we tolerate algorithmically driven systems that focus on engagement and attention, over other values, like tolerance and understanding?“The battle for the future of the internet is now joined.”We do not know the right answers to these questions. What we do know is that we will make better collective decisions armed with evidence, independent insight, and thoughtful deliberation.Unprecedented and paradigm-shifting disruptions of this scale require an equal investment in finding solutions to the problems they pose. That means bringing together leaders and institutions in the field to provide independent, rigorous and possibly conflicting answers to equip policymakers and the public as we navigate these urgent debates. A new set of investments of more than $3.5 million by Knight Foundation to fund just this kind of research and development is a first step in this direction, but it is only the beginning. Others need to join the fray as well, and invest in the future of our democracy.The new tech-driven information ecosystem is messy. There will be no easy answers. But by doing the hard, necessary work of determining how we can best chart these new waters, we can take productive steps toward harnessing tech as a force for good — in media; in how the public informs itself; and ultimately in how our democracy itself functions.The controversies and concerns about how our democracy can thrive in a digital age are immense and immediate. The decisions ahead are daunting. But we can’t overcome challenges that we don’t understand. To tackle these issues sufficiently, we must begin with evidence and insight. Our democracy can’t afford to be dictated by conventional wisdom.Sam Gill is VP/Communities and Impact and Senior Adviser to the President at Knight Foundation.

We know very well the challenges that entrepreneurs, called “creators”, face when marketing their projects.One of the greatest challenges involves engaging the community and increasing a project’s exposure. How can a creator turn their financial backers into his or her greatest helpers?In the creator Dashboard, creators can easily manage their project information and add “Bonuses”. Doing so allows the creator to recruit the entire Pledgecamp community to help promote and improve their projects. We call this enabling the “Smart Crowd”.Pledge Coins allow creators to instantly and transparently compensate any member of the Smart Crowd after they perform the desired task. It also lets them reach a global crowd unencumbered by borders, currency issues, or banking limitations.If the creator is not familiar with cryptocurrency, we plan on making acquiring PLG seamless and easy for them. Usability is paramount, so that users simply know these great features work without necessarily being advanced blockchain experts.Once the Bonus is “live”, any Pledgecamp user can submit an entry. The creator can easily view the submissions, approve or deny them, and add new bonuses at any time.That’s it! As you’ve seen, the simplified UI design makes it extremely easy to post new bonuses and manage submissions.Here are some ways the Smart Crowd might help creators be successful on Pledgecamp. By no means it is an exhaustive list — the only limit is the imagination of project creators and the crowd!The above-mentioned bounty possibilities constitute Pledgecamp’s internal gig economy which can be automated, scaled, and tracked across the globe. Incentivizing these activities through monetization will empower users to express their passion and skill sets to grow the creator’s project.The UI for backers is the flip side of the design for creators, and is similarly simple and flexible. Users can view the requirements, upload documents, messages, or links to the creator, and that’s it.Backers know that these bonuses are fully pre-funded, and that only the best quality submissions will stand out among the pack.Enabling the Smart Crowd with PLG is just one of the ways Pledgecamp is bringing new functionality to crowdfunding by using blockchain and cryptocurrency.Follow our future posts for deeper looks at Backer Insurance, the Market Network, Knowledge Center, and more! Each of these brings much-needed new possibilities to crowdfunding that will ultimately help creators be more successful, and bring new products and value into the world.For more details about the Pledgecamp platform, refer to our white paper accessible at https://pledgecamp.com/whitepaper.This post may contain forward-looking statements about the future functionality of the platform. The platform is currently in development, and we reserve the right to make changes to the design, names, or functionality of features in the interests of making the platform successful.

Then you realize how can I set up those two technologies together? Well, this article is made precisely for you. I’ll show you how to set up a GraphQL server using MongoDB. I will show you how you can modularize your GraphQL schema and all this using MLab as our database.All the code from this article is available here.So now, let’s get started.GraphQL is a query language for your APIs. It was released by Facebook back in 2015 and has gained a very high adoption. It’s the replacement of REST.With GraphQL, the client can ask for the exact data that they need and get back exactly what they asked for. GraphQL also uses a JSON-like query syntax to make those requests. All requests go to the same endpoint.If you’re reading this article, I assume that you know a little bit about GraphQL. If you don’t know, you can learn more about GraphQL here.First, create a folder, then start our project.Then install some dependencies for our project.And then @babel/node as a dev dependency:Now we’re gonna set up Babel for our project. Create a file called .babelrc in your project folder. Then, put the @babel/env there, like this:Then go to your package.json and add some scripts:We’ll have only one script that we’re gonna use in our project.“server” — It will mainly run our server.Now, in our root folder create the index.js file. It will be where we’re gonna make our server.First, we’re gonna import all the modules that we’ll use.Then, we’re gonna create our connect with MongoDB using Mongoose:What about that db const? This is where you’re gonna put your database URL to connect MongoDB. Then you’re gonna say to me: “But, I don’t have a database yet”, yes I got you. For that, we’re using MLab.MLab is a database-as-a-service for MongoDB, all you need to do is go to their website (click here) and register.After you register, go and create a new database. To use as free, choose this option:Choose US East (Virginia) as an option, and then give our database a name. After that, our database will show at the home page.Click on our database, then go to User and create a new user. In this example, I’m gonna create a user called leo and password leoleo1.After our user is created, on the top of our page, we find two URLs. One to connect using Mongo Shell. The other to connect using a MongoDB URL. We copy the second one.After that, all you need to do is paste that URL on our db const at the index.js file. Our db const would look like this:Now we’re gonna finally start our server. For that, we’ve put some more lines in our index.js and we’re done.Now, run the command npm run server and go to localhost:4000/graphql and you’ll find a page like this:Now, in our root folder, make a folder named models and create a file inside called User.js (yes, with capital U).Inside of User.js, we’re gonna create our first schema in MongoDB using Mongoose.Now that we have created our User schema, we’re gonna start with GraphQL.In our root folder, we’re gonna create a folder called graphql. Inside that folder, we’re gonna create a file called index.js and two more folders: resolvers and types.Queries in GraphQL are the way we ask our server for data. We ask for the data that we need, and it returns exactly that data.All our queries will be inside our types folder. Inside that folder, create an index.js file and a User folder.Inside the User folder, we’re gonna create an index.js file and write our queries.In our types folder, in our index.js file, we’re gonna import all the types that we have. For now, we have the User types.In case you have more than one type, you import that to your file and include in the typeDefs array.Mutations in GraphQL are the way we modify data in the server.All our mutations will be inside our resolvers folder. Inside that folder, create an index.js file and a User folder.Inside the User folder, we’re gonna create an index.js file and write our mutations.Now that all our resolvers and mutations are ready, we’re gonna modularize our schema.Inside our folder called graphql, go to our index.js and make our schema, like this:Now that our schema is done, go to our root folder and inside our index.js import our schema.After all that, our schema will end up like this:To test our queries and mutations, we’re gonna start our server with the command npm run server, and go to localhost:4000/graphql.First, we’re gonna create our first user with a mutation:After that, if the GraphiQL playground returns to you the data object that we created, that means that our server is working fine.To make sure, go to MLab, and inside of our users collection, check if there is our data that we just created.After that, create another user called “Max Stoiber”. We add this user to make sure that our mutation is working fine and we have more than one user in the database.To delete a user, our mutation will go like this:Like the other one, if the GraphiQL playground returns to you the data object that we created, that means that our server is working fine.To get all users, we’re gonna run our first query like this:Since we only have one user, it should return that exact user.To get a specific user, this will be the query:That should return the exact user.Our server is running, our queries and mutations are working fine, we’re good to go and start our client. You can start with create-react-app. In your root folder just give the command create-react-app client and then, if you run the command npm run dev, our server and client will run concurrently!All the code from this article is available here.🐦 Follow me on Twitter! ⭐ Follow me on GitHub!I’m looking for a remote opportunity, so if have any I’d love to hear about it, so please contact me!----13We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/newsLeonardo MaldonadoinFotonTech--8TK--132Preethi KasireddyinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--111Leonardo MaldonadoinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--35Melih YumakinJavaScript in Plain English--12Razvan LinDev Genius--Ibrahim AhmedinBootcamp--7Hussein Nasser--37inVerita--1Rémy VillullesinJavaScript in Plain English--2HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Leonardo Maldonado,https://medium.com/@leonardomso,"8, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*rhpr5EnxrphBwqyTus0jmg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JDDQnoWbkwJM4R_MFVCB4A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*q25QbcqFOFHIVtxtedxfFw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*BIhNVFafvKf1kEgDbQ4j9g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*U2vN26hF2kLC_8JXtUMvyA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kY0ftzycpo0QwjRgc0eFUA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*r_o7jCMP0fQdiFDsozGoWg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*A6UZ-KVEhOthrgFO4qZxcg.png",6,2173

95,41537,https://medium.com/@katiekingmba/empowering-the-next-generation-with-ai-b8d9658f0623?source=tag_archive---------155-----------------------,Empowering the Next Generation with AI,None,"Katie KingFollow--ListenShareThe world is changing and it’s doing so incredibly fast. For the youths of today this means one significant thing: we don’t quite know yet what the jobs of tomorrow will be. On 29 August, I’m presenting at 2019’s #TEENSINAI ACCELERATOR. This wonderful two-week-long event introduces teens to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and teaches them how the technology will most likely play a role in the top jobs of the future. However, before you can even begin to advise a 14-year-old on the potential of the AI job market, you first need to make AI cool.If you have read my book (and if you haven’t, you can check it out here), then you would know that I absolutely love to find key examples of AI across all industries, especially when the particular example makes you look up and mutter under your breath, “Wow!” In other words, it has the cool factor. To begin then, I am going to start by outlining several super cool AI projects which should impress many ambitious young people.First, we begin with YouTuber Taryn Southern’s recent album called ‘I AM AI’ in which she uses AI to generate music and melodies for the entire album. Second, I turn to AI programs such as the Compta system which are being used to help better prepare for and handle climate change-caused extreme weather conditions like flooding, hail, and wildfires such as those seen recently in the Amazon. Next we see that YouTube has been using AI to identify and remove objectionable content; to let users change their video backgrounds without the need for specialised software and to provide targeted suggestions for the “Up Next” autoplay videos.Moving on to the medical world, AI software has detected 5 new types of breast cancer and is able to identify which types of cancers will respond to which treatments. Meanwhile, AI is being used in sports to improve performance and fan experience. IBM Watson analysed all the match footage, crowd noises, player facial expressions, and key moments to create highlight footage for this year’s tennis US Open. It also has the capability to provide coaching data, and even offers strategy recommendations to players creating “Fantasy” sports rosters. Then there is the beauty industry, which is making more tailored and inclusive product ranges by analysing their effectiveness on your skin or hair type, and offering more precise recommendations.Whether it be entertainment, medical breakthroughs, climate change or fashion and beauty, I genuinely believe that it would be pretty tough for any youngster today to not see the ‘cool factor’ in AI. What is perhaps more exciting however, is that this generation, with such a profound headstart into this up and coming industry, will be able to access many exciting jobs within the world of Artificial Intelligence.There is no doubt that AI is affecting all areas of business commerce. Ultimately, it’s what all the numbers are predicting. A recent McKinsey study found that the job roles most likely to be affected by automation involve predictable physical work: it is believed that 78% of the physical tasks will be able to be automated by adapting current technology. Furthermore, Deloitte has found that middle-income jobs are most at risk for AI replacement/automation, with UK jobs with wages of £30,000 or under being five times more susceptible to AI automation than jobs paying upwards of £100,000. Considering the numbers then, it is crucial that as responsible adults we provide the framework for the next generations to be effective and successful members of the workforce.The prospect of AI is not all doom and gloom for the upcoming generation getting into employment. In fact, a 2018 report from the World Economic Forum even suggested that while we may displace 75 million jobs globally by 2022, we will create a net positive of 133 million new ones.A recent article from BuiltIn contains a this quote about the positive outlook that we should be explaining to today’s young people:“The US’s BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] forecasts faster-than-average job growth in many occupations that AI is expected to impact: accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, dietitians, financial specialists, web developers, loan officers, medical secretaries, and customer service representatives, to name a very few. These fields will not experience job growth in spite of AI but because of it.”Furthermore, it’s not the jobs that AI is replacing that youths should worry about. What is more exciting, is the potential for new job positions to be invented. The Manufacturer outlined some of the exciting (and ‘cool’) predicted jobs of the future:Predictions and assumptions are great, but the real takeaway from this blog is that AI is really, really, cool. And rather than being afraid of potential negative implications for one’s future, the youth of today should be excited for the doors that it will open up.For further reading, check out this article from It Pro which outlines how AI will soon be redefining the whole working environment.I’m really excited to present at #TEENSINAI ACCELERATOR this week and emphasise the above views. AI is incredibly exciting and I’m just a little bit jealous that you guys have longer to see where it can take us!----Published author, keynote speaker, trainer, consultant, and specialist in artificial intelligence.

LemkinFollow--ListenShareA little while back, I wrote about my learnings only using Lime + Bird for a week in San Diego. The TL;DR: it was awesome — but with plenty of near-term challenges:medium.comI recently did the same with our Model 3 and “Just/Only Supercharging” for a week.The Model 3 is simply the best gadget and piece of tech I have bought in years. We bought an early Model S in the beginning of 2012, and it was a bit … meh. It was too wide, too big, didn’t have Autopilot, didn’t have any real safety tech, the front seats hurt my back, the kids got nauseous in the back seat and the jump seat, etc.Fast forward to the Model 3 of 2018–2019, and everything is awesome. Autopilot is amazing, it’s the right size to park and take anywhere, it’s much better built, etc. It’s a 10. Far better than not just any other car, but any other gadget of the year. Sorry, Jibo, Portal, etc.And most of time, you just drive it home and plug it in every night, like your mobile phone, and that 250+ miles of overnight-charging range gets you everywhere.But what if you can’t plug it in every night, and have a longer drive every day?That’s what I did for a week. Commuting 65–100 miles a day in the Model 3, all around the SF Bay Area without charging at home:That meant basically Supercharging 3 times a week to have a buffer!What did I learn commuting longer distances without home charging?Looking forward to 120A charging!That’s probably what we really need to make it all work for longer-distance commuting.----SaaStr.

The heat shields were hand applied,"Holly ReynoldsFollow--ListenShareWhen John F. Kennedy told Congress in May 1961 that he wanted to land man on the moon before the decade was over, that was actually impossible to do at that point in time. Even a year later, when he made his famous speach about landing on the moon at Rice University, very little had been done to advance those technologies. Many of the technologies that were used to land Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins safely on the moon hadn’t even been invented yet. It’s no surprise, then, that some items that actually got us to the moon, were done by hand. Here are a list of 4 of those things.The heat shields for the Apollo program were specially designed and created to give the astronauts maximum protection as the re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. A plastic honeycomb was wrapped around the command module. It was then filled with an ablative (removable), heat-resistant material, varying in thickness for the greatest protection. This material would melt away as the module re-entered the atmosphere. The plastic honeycomb was fragile, and the heat protective material was thick and putty-like. These spaces were hand-filled using a specially designed caulking gun. The guns used to fill the thinner areas had an automatic trigger so the operator wouldn’t get tired. The thicker areas had to be done with guns with standard triggers.Star Charts and Sextants have been around for centuries, and were the go-to navigation devices for ocean explorers during the night before computer navigation was invented. That type of navigation system was invented for the Apollo missions, but because it was such new technology, it couldn’t be fully trusted to safely navigate the astronauts to the moon. They used star charts and sextants to double check their bearings and make it to the moon. They would then enter the data into their computers to keep the computers on track.It seems hard to conceive in a time when most of our clothes are sewn by a machine in a factory (or by someone who uses that machine), that a suit made to keep the astronauts alive would be hand-sewn. The suits were made by Playtex, who was known for making durable and flexible articles of clothing (like their famous bras). Each suit was made of 21 layers of nested fabric; strong enough to stop a micrometeorite, but flexible enough to move around in. No machines could guarantee the quality and security like a group of expert seamstresses could. With all the gallivanting that Aldrin and Armstrong did while walking around the surface of the moon, it is a good thing the spacesuits had to live up to such high standards. The astronauts were safe and sound in their suits.The space suits weren’t the only thing that was hand sewn. The parachutes, nine in total, used to slow the command module before it hit the ocean were hand sewn. They were then hand folded before being placed inside the module. The three main parachutes were 83.5 feet in diameter. There were three people in the nation who were certified to fold the parachutes and were required to never ride in the same vehicle in case they were in a car accident and all injured. It took six years to develop parachutes that would safely bring the astronauts home, so the jobs of sewing and folding them were very important and crucial to the success of the parachutes and the mission.Although many advances in technology were made to make the Apollo 11 moon landing a success, many of the key features required a hand-made approach. Everything on this list was crucial to the safety of the astronauts. These things could all probably done with machines these days, but it’s nice to know that hard-working men and women were what made the moon landing possible and not fancy spacecrafts and computers.----Holly ReynoldsinThe Startup--Holly Reynolds--Holly Reynolds--Holly Reynolds--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Holly Reynolds,https://medium.com/@hollyreynolds10,"5, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*C1UKVkeeMD94XK_JiNZtvA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*k0WcyUVyNNDp7gWrLgeVtA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*38JNB007p3tsLSlkW-9eDQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VPEkLOvyaPErWl90EHdGqg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*cARzrgYruT_pyH-ty0rgVA.jpeg",4,52

These campaigns are operating in multiple media outlets, including online, billboards and television ads,” said Dr. Craig Ratner, chair of the ADA Council on Dental Practice. Dr. Ratner continued: “This year’s ADA House of Delegates recognized the need for the ADA, as America’s leading advocate for oral health, to take steps to educate patients about the potential pitfalls of self-managed orthodontic treatment. This new policy supports the importance of dentists being in charge of diagnosing and treating patients to ensure the safe delivery of appropriate care.”Dr. Yan Kalika, Founder of Image Orthodontics, and graduate of University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry, as well as Harvard Medical School, explains that “while some cases can be treated using advanced communication technology, still many patients do require orthodontist guidance in the treatment plan not to only create the perfect smile, but achieve a healthy smile, bite, and facial balance. There are too many moving parts in orthodontics and at Image Orthodontics, we combine the latest technology with professional orthodontists to provide a hybrid solution that is affordable, safe, and as accelerated and convenient for the patient as possible.”Ultimately, it is important that the industry innovates and continuously makes treatment more affordable, more convenient, and more effective. The American Association for Orthodontists suggests that every child have an orthodontic evaluation by the age of 7. Statistically, 75% of 12-year-olds need orthodontic treatment. However by age 12, 90% of a child’s face has already developed. Earlier detection and treatment gives a child a better chance for natural and normal smile development. Adding on, working with natural growth instead of against it, it is possible to prevent progression of problems.----Award winning dentists with thousands of happy patients over 20 years.Image Orthodontics--Image Orthodontics--Image Orthodontics--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Image Orthodontics,https://medium.com/@ImageOrtho,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8II9odE0uwUnh3Q7I3trWw.jpeg",2,0

All of these encompass the same general idea of a type that could be one of many types. Those of you coming from the functional programming world will already be very familiar with the concept. If you’re not familiar, no worries. Let’s jump right into an example. Say we want to model how a stoplight works. A stoplight can be one of three specific colors red, yellow, or green, but it can only be one at a time.That’s great now we can model some data that can only be one of a distinct set of values, but what if instead we wanted to model data the could optionally have a value. The Option type seems like an important idea since Rust doesn’t have a null type.In Rust, the Maybe type is a built-in type called Option. You use Option the same way you use Maybe, but you don’t have to prefix your values with “Maybe::.”We now have a way of modeling data that could be one of a finite set of values, and we can also of model data that could be missing. What if we wanted to model data that could be one of two different types such as a string or an integer?The Either type is a little less straight forward than the previous two examples. An everyday use case for Either is when you may want to return an error string from a function if some computation failed.Pattern matching is where we see the power of enumerations start to shine. With pattern matching, we are looking at what possible shape some data could be in a trying to fit it into the right hole.When dealing with strings or integers the data could be any one of an infinite number of values, but with enumerations, there is a finite number of known values for the compiler to check. Pattern matching against all possible cases is known as an exhaustive pattern match.Let’s take a look at our earlier code where the value that could have been either an integer or a failure string. Only, this time, we can use the data and performs some operations on it if it is an integer or let the user know what went wrong.Enumerations are a powerful tool that allows you to make data types that can be used to represent one of a discrete set of values. Structs and Enumerations are the two core pieces behind algebraic data types, which is one of the core pieces of functional programming.----Shawn Bachlet--Shawn Bachlet--Shawn Bachlet--Shawn Bachlet--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Bruce H.

Various problems that occur in the community must be solved in an intelligent manner. This is certainly not easy because several factors can act as inhibitors. This is what must be addressed through the application of methods that can actually show a solution. In terms of trade transactions, many problems are still on the waiting list to be resolved. This task is carried out by experts who are required to be able to demonstrate professionalism through the creation of a technology. Technology is generally needed to achieve every desire and goal. This will then show real solutions that can alleviate the problems that arise.Related to the trading system, the community faces several major problems. in this case the main focus is on the business sector. There are millions of types of businesses that are currently running and dominating the world. But not a few types of businesses are just starting their steps. Some of the problems that are of great concern to the world today are in terms of business development in order to run stably. Many business companies take advantage of the full role of technology in the process. Whether it’s in terms of product creation or in the use of the product itself. In disseminating information to promote products, the technology used is also increasingly sophisticated. This can help the development of businesses and businesses that were originally constrained in their movements.The media currently used to promote products is through a website. Currently there are thousands of websites whose main function is online shops. Through this web system, people can buy any product more easily which is primarily felt through its access. Users now no longer need to travel to certain stores over long distances to obtain products. this will reduce the effective time of the community, especially those who struggle in busy routines every day. The website will provide convenience in shopping. Every company can now take advantage of this function. Although at first this shows positive values ​​and high optimism for better change, new problems are slowly emerging. The greater number of users accessing their media, making this a new responsibility for website managers.The technology they use must be constantly updated from time to time in order to be able to adjust it to the demands of the community. the creation of new technology continues until this reaches its peak in terms of the accumulation of the amount of debt. Technology development certainly requires a very large amount of funds. if this is not in line with the many benefits obtained, then the website manager must be forced to borrow in advance in order to use the technology first. This will certainly affect the users of their website where it is not impossible that these costs will be borne by every business owner who peddles their products on the website. Excessive expenditure is certainly not something that is expected by every group so they have to think hard to find a solution.This is an example of a case faced by most business people who entrust the role of technology through websites to trade their products. The solution offered for this problem is to start a new step in Sessia. Sessia is a type of digital application that can be used by every business manager to carry out their trading activities. This application actually provides greater benefits, especially in terms of cost savings. Sessia provides facilities for trading products that do not impose any fees in the process of registering and making digital stores. The Sessia platform will only benefit through every purchase transaction which is also supported by cashback. The Sessia technology system will simply run the process from offering to product buying and shipping. the profits obtained by each business actor will be greater and they can save more funds because some billing functions are not applied. This greatly benefits users who do not have large financial support but want to further expand their business network. The solution is just joining Sessia. with a few easy steps users can create their own digital store and fill in the various products they create with a very attractive appearance.

111,3017,https://medium.com/@tedhill_2588/virtual-nation-states-194f4db778f6?source=tag_archive---------121-----------------------,Virtual Nation-States,None,"Ted HillFollow--1ListenShareA governance of people united by a singular culture regardless of locationThe internet was once described as a wild west. A frontier of opportunity and unknown dangers. That time is long past. We are even well past settlements. We live in a time of city-states. A time that is quickly coming to an end.The nation-states are rising. Indeed, several are already well on their way to banding together city-states into grand alliances towards various ends.Why is this happening?What does this mean for the world on the grand scale?How will these virtual nation-states function?What does this mean for individual people?Let us begin with why this is happening.In short, this is what people do.The longer version can be seen in the history of our species. We push boundaries out of necessity or curiosity. New frontiers are discovered as new tools and techniques bring greater sustainability. Settlements are founded where enough of us come together to exploit resources and find security in numbers. Successful settlements become permanent cities and develop their own history, culture, and rules. Finally nations emerge as alliances between cities and peoples of like interests. Those interests could be trade, social ties, physical proximity, or even shared ideals.The creation of our modern internet provided us with a new frontier. As our tech improved, more and more space was opened to settlement. We found plenty of resources to exploit. We found that this virtual space could be leveraged into real world profit. We also came to treasure an old resource on a whole new scale: Information.Information has always been powerful. This wasn’t news to anyone. What was new was an entire parallel world made of almost nothing but information. Almost, because there are still real world items and infrastructure needed to access this parallel world. However, the real world cost of accessing this parallel world has plummeted to the point that access to this frontier is unprecedented in human history. Never has the cost of entry and sustenance been so inexpensive for so many people. Never has there been so much ‘space’ to go around. There are still limits, to be sure, but this expanse enabled a single generation to go from wild frontier to knitting flags.What does this mean on a global scale?At this point I dare say anyone reading this knows the world has gotten ‘smaller’. Yes, we all have heard it marveled that you can stay connected across the globe. It is becoming something more impactful. We can move objects and affect the real world physically regardless of our location. The scale of affects and breadth of options is only growing. The line between real and virtual space is blurring.In real space we already have long established nation-states. Like all colonies of history, the settlers of the new frontier brought their native culture with them. And, like all colonies before them, those cultures changed and developed partially independently. The greater the disconnect the more independent the culture can grow. Now that the disconnect is becoming less the real space parent cultures can exert more control over the virtual colonies. Indeed, real China famously exerts tight control over virtual China. So much so that virtual China is already a nation-state because it and real China are the same thing.China is a standout exception. In most places the virtual world exists as a mass dotted by all manner and size of city-states. Truly massive city-states like Alphabet and Apple hold dominance over precious virtual resources and legions of people. There is, however, still a lot of room for many other smaller city-states. Even the smallest can continue on so long as it provides a service that real persons find enough value in.These virtual city-states still operate dependant on the real world. As such, the real nations partly allow the virtual nations to exist. The line between worlds has not blurred to the point that the virtual space can be considered coequal let alone superior to real space. Perhaps it never will on a global scale. That means that virtual nations will need at least some protection from real nations.With that limitation in mind, how can a virtual nation-state form and operate?Virtual nations will need to satisfy 4 broad aspects:If a place and people to exist seems rather basic that’s because it is. It is also totally dependent on assets in real space. A place must be secured by servers and some method of communication to form a network. Real people need to be able to access these networks and have enough reason to want to. Without these real pieces there is not only no virtual nation but also no virtual city, settlement, or any virtual space of worth at all.Infrastructure to safely connect members is a more blurred aspect. This includes the creation of platforms for services and protocols for secure transfer of information. An economy of some sort of real world value must be created and protected. This economy need not be a standard real economy. It will be based on the already established services of member virtual cities and linking them must provide some benefit. Some methods of disrupting these secure links and platforms are real world based. While there is some blurring most of this aspect remains virtual.A system of governance is a stage that has arguably just been emerging virtually in the last decade. It is almost entirely virtual excepting that it must be built on the above infrastructure and [assumedly] will rely on real people as ultimate arbiters of power. This system must determine what power and authority is agreed to reside with whom and how. There must also be a method for how those powers and authorities will change persons, strengths, and configurations. These need not be codified, an absolutist governance can change its methods arbitrarily.Keep in mind that power here is ultimately derived from real sources and that real infrastructure is just as critical as real people. In real space people have always had a certain level of power derived from them. It has never been the case that the land you stand on could simply vanish from existence on command. Because this can happen in virtual spaces, governances that would not work reasonably in a real nation may work in a virtual nation.A reason for unity may start in a variety of different ways but will quickly become a set of defining ideals, an ethos. This is completely virtual. In fact, these have been virtual for as long as we have had real nations and real peoples. As with all nations in our history it is so helpful to codify these principles that we have always done so. Be it a constitution, a monumental code, or a spoken creed. The medium only needs to be accessable to any potential and current member. The process of codification is itself important and informs the resulting ethos. A negotiated social contract is very different in feel than edicts of a single founder. No doubt the ethos and thus the ‘correct’ read of code will change, they always have, so there must also be a method of update or arbiters of orthodoxy. This ethos unites real people into a new virtual nation. What happens after that gets complicated.What does this possibility of virtual citizenship mean for us?It is important to recall that the virtual world depends on the real world. So citizenship in a real nation is more basically critical to a person than a virtual citizenship. This is not to say that virtual citizenship will be unimportant, far from it.Could there be wars between virtual nations with real casualties?Yes, there already are and have been.At the time of this writing a war has been going on in virtual space between the newly established virtual nation of Silicon Valley Social Justice and the developing virtual nation of Western Liberalists. The older SVSJ started claiming livelihoods and occasional lives a few years back. Compared to a real war the level of destruction is barely noticable. It has, however, had a dramatic civic and political affect across multiple real nations.The SVSJ has already secured virtual nationhood. It has powerful real people and robust places needed to exist. It has established platforms and secure channels to link the titanic members. It has been running on a aristocratic council form of governance that rules by edict, sometimes arbitrarily. It also has a method of changing terms and people of power through a kind of priestly caste. These ordained justice educated arbiters review both imbedded within and from without the member virtual cities. These then derive their power from evocation of outrage mobs of real people. This priest caste is also charged with the codification and keeping of the orthodox ethos, which can change slowly over time by popular call.The Western Liberalists are nationalizing as a necessity in reaction to the SVSJ. They have plenty of people. Their grip on a place to exist is unsure but mostly secure. Their platforms and networks are not secure and have often not stood up to attack by the SVSJ. Without that foundation they are scrambling to develop any kind of governance. They are well on their way to developing an ethos. It is not fully codified and lacks methods to grow and be altered. One large question is from where they will derive their supply of power. Will real nations move to support them? Will some move against them?This conflict, along with China’s national model, gives us our first glimpses of what is to come. We have learned that real nations are not going away. Actions between virtual nations can hurt and possibly kill people in real space. Virtual nations come from our own nature and are inevitable given virtual space.What does it mean for our everyday life?We should be paying at least some attention to the formation and actions of the virtual nations. How different real nations treat them differently, taking sides. How conflicts in virtual space spill over to affect real politics, culture, and people’s lives.This doesn’t yet mean everyone must get involved, choose virtual sides, and swear virtual allegiance. The virtual space isn’t that influential yet. The blurring of worlds does not seem to be slowing down though. It might be wise to take note before an unpalatable virtual citizenship is forced on those in real space.----1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ted Hill,https://medium.com/@tedhill_2588,0,7,0

Every passing day technology is impacting our lives more and more . There is never a single minute of the day where technology is not being used , even outside of earth.I believe that the development of technology has certainly had a great impact in the workplace in regards to increased efficiency, performance and productivity . At the same time it has also eliminated human errors and many other factors of riskWhen talking about technology and employability , many people believe that technology has significantly decreased jobs however there is evidence to prove that this is certainly not the case. Technology has actually created more jobs than it has destroyed and 140 years of data proves this. Studies of census results in Wales and England since 1871 discover that the rise of machines has been a job creator rather than making human work obsolete.Studies have shown that hard , dangerous and dull jobs have decreasedAs a result , caring jobs have risenThe census report found a 909% increase in nursing and assistant jobs over the last 20 years. An analysis of the United Kingdom Labour Force Survey from the office of National Statistics show that the number of these kinds of workers soared from 30,000 to 300,000 between 1992 and 2014.Similarly , in the same time period there was an· 580 percent increase educational support assistants and teaching fields· 183 percent increase in housing , welfare and youth and community workers· 168 percent increase in at home carers and case workersWhile on the other hand , there was a· 79 percent decrease in knitters and weavers from approximately 24,000 to 5000· 57 percent decrease in typists· 50 percent decrease in company secretariesIncrease in efficiency, performance and productivity in the workplace1.Thanks to technology factors such as the need for manual file sharing has been eliminated .File sharing tools make it easy for employees to track the history of edits and changes that may have been carried out with an document.2. Similarly advanced payroll technology has also made employees life a lot more easier. For example these digital technologies can easily take into account the number of hours a employee has worked and automatically add it onto a time sheet.3. Self service has additionally made employees lives very easy. For instance , instead taking a long route to the human resources department (HR) , employees can now access exactly what is needed from their workstation and print forms and document themselves.In conclusion , I believe that I have provided enough evidence in relation to the fact that technology has created more jobs for society . It has given people the chance to increase their health and lifestyle by decreasing hard , dangerous and dull jobs while increasing caring jobs. Furthermore as a result it has also increased individuals economic , socioeconomic , and physical well-being.Referenceswww.cimaglobal.comwww.quickfms.com----1Fatima Khan--Fatima Khan--2The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Fatima Khan,https://medium.com/@fami92430,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UPFSfKNHHpaTVQMaXWogbw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mDsLfoH0dRs1LfaTOT3V_g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mUFvkk2artrtSG6axug3Pw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*krPT9OErLeyFLuP3jO2OPQ.jpeg",3,0

Anonymity is intended to provide a higher level of privacy by not involving a number of data from transactions that take place to be available in general access. This support is the latest innovation built by Veil which also gives more advantages compared to similar platforms. It’s not enough to just carry blockchain technology, Veil also presents Zerocoin and RingCT technologies that have a number of undeniable advantages in terms of anonymity. Anonymity has a direct relationship with the element of privacy. Anonymity will directly support the existence of privacy within Veil’s technology network. If privacy is said to be a form of personal freedom, anonymity refers to the unavailability of a supporting identity. Zerocoin and RingCT technology creates the Veil network system to be anonymous for data. Users who generally want a private domain that is not known by others for the data and information they have will be greatly helped by the presence of this platform. Transactions will be more freely carried out by each party and only related parties know the detailed information.To improve the functionality of the platform, Veil designed an idea gained from long experience in conducting research and exploration directly into the cryptocurrency trading market. Each feature presented in it will be adjusted directly to the needs of the user. This platform not only provides perfect anonymity services but also supports the user experience in digitally transacting. The experience was realized through a multi-transaction Zerocoin spend or Zerocoin multi-transaction expenditure system. This refers to the system of transactions carried out from one platform to another with a digital wallet intermediary that is connected directly through a network system. Users can make multi-block transactions transparently with the amount of funds sent can be adjusted in various sizes. Each transaction will generate data in the form of a track record of transactions with a small file size. Veil uses BIP-0039 / BIP-0044 Deterministic Seed to avoid data backup that can meet storage capacity. Deterministic Seed also acts as a digital wallet restorer that supports Basecoin and Zerocoin transactions. Dompet Veil will give users the choice to store data in large capacity and will continue to increase, known as the process of trimming transactions so that any transactions that are deemed unnecessary will be removed from storage.This platform was founded by James Burden. He is an expert in the world of industry with intelligence above average in the field of engineering and entrepreneurship. He was noted to have established the PIVX platform and was one of the founders of the zDEX and Exobit platforms. His interest in cryptocurrency has existed since he first recognized the world by mining Bitcoin. He made this a very pleasant hobby and in the end this also led him to the world of cryptocurrency even further in 2012. He has been involved in many cryptocurrency-focused platform development projects. From the various experiences that he has gained and the knowledge that comes from experts where he has always been involved with them, it has provided enough provisions to build the Veil platform. Starting with a simple project, without realizing it, this is the first step for every individual to enjoy a new atmosphere in digital transactions. The highlight of the project was proven by the launch of the first Veil platform at the end of 2018.James Burden is currently supported by a number of experts in various fields that contribute to the Veil platform which consists of:While Veil’s advisory team consists of ‘Ant’, Florian, Justin Lee, ‘Notsofast’, and Tony Kim.Veil has initiated the important concept of creating a digital platform through the provision of anonymity technology. The availability of privacy has become a number of values ​​for all technology users.

120,14524,https://medium.com/point72-ventures/building-the-better-call-center-with-polyai-aeacc17a101c?source=tag_archive---------70-----------------------,Building the better call center with PolyAI,None,"Point72 VenturesFollowPoint72 Ventures--ListenShareSri Chandrasekar and Daniel Kwak, Point72 Ventures, Artificial Intelligence“Please stay on the line for the next representative…” is a phrase we are all too familiar with that engenders mild feelings of anxiety and dread. However, calling customer service is an unavoidable part of our lives. Whether it’s paying the utilities bill, troubleshooting Wi-Fi, or rescheduling a flight, anytime we come across a problem, we usually need a human on the phone to help us resolve it. Any way you look at it, customer service is a mission critical problem that will only get harder to manage. Many systems are interconnected now, so customers are more likely to experience similar problems at the same time and overwhelm support agents. This explains why over $200 billion is spent each year on customer support, with the amount expected to double by 2024¹.As early-stage AI investors at Point72 Ventures, we have been looking for technologies that could make customer service better, faster, and cheaper. In particular, we were interested in AI-powered dialogue systems so robust that customers would rather speak to them than human agents. But despite the promise of AI transforming call centers, we are still far away from the “magical” AI agent that can automate all customer interactions. Even Google Duplex, considered the most advanced AI agent in this space, is still limited to simpler interactions like booking restaurant reservations and salon appointments. As advanced as it seems, we’re still pretty far away from AI agents walking us through each step of installing a modem and router (i.e. “What black cable? In what port? …nope, it’s still not blinking green”).Our frustrations with customer service can be categorized into three buckets — 1) long wait times, 2) dumb interactive voice response (IVR) systems, and 3) inexperienced call center agents. Long wait times are terrible and are one of the top 5 gripes of customer support² (chart shown below). How all too real is the story of a cancelled 11pm flight that leaves hundreds of people meandering around the airport terminal, waiting on 2+ hour holds to rebook their flights? Also, at some point, we’ll come across the interactive voice response (IVR) system. This system was designed to make calls better by efficiently routing us to the agent most likely to answer our questions. Instead, these IVR systems are mostly exasperating, causing us to mash 0 immediately upon hearing the cold robotic voice and demanding to get connected to a human ASAP. Lastly, once we’re finally connected to a human agent, he or she might be unable to answer our question, completing the perfect storm that is known as customer support.There are structural reasons for these issues. The IVR systems we are greeted with are often rigid, low-level systems, which quickly frustrate us, driving us to demand human agents and drag out wait times. These systems also further compound the problem because they are unable to understand the varied syntax of human speech, forcing us to repeat the same information multiple times. Additionally, call centers can be tough places to work and face massive turnover with agents staying only an average of 12 months. To keep their lines staffed, call centers are forced to rapidly hire and train agents by the hundreds each week; this turnover means that agents are always inexperienced, which further exacerbates long call times and low customer satisfaction.We believe that PolyAI can transform this industry from the bottom up. When we first met Nikola, Shawn, and Eddy, we were impressed by their humility about the problem and ability to empathize with the call center agent. Although Nikola, Shawn, and Eddy all received their PhDs in AI-powered dialogue systems from the University of Cambridge, they were the first to admit that AI would not be the “magic wand” in this industry. Instead of replacing human agents, the PolyAI team is focused on deeply understanding and learning from them — everything from call routing to how they logged calls once completed — and build technology that can make these agents smarter and faster. To do this, PolyAI is not planning on selling software to call centers but to become the call center itself. Through deep integration with the day-to-day operations, PolyAI aims to become the AI-driven call center that redefines what it means to call customer service, and we are thrilled to be PolyAI’s Series A lead investor for this journey.¹ “Market Size: Just How Big is the Call Center Industry?”, CustomerServ, 25-Oct-2017.² “Top 4 Contact Center Trends for 2015”, Fonolo, 28-Jan-2015.----Point72 VenturesBuild the future together.Point72 VenturesinPoint72 Ventures--Point72 VenturesinPoint72 Ventures--Point72 VenturesinPoint72 Ventures--Point72 VenturesinPoint72 Ventures--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Point72 Ventures,https://medium.com/@Point72Ventures,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*qkAHf5J6FE9RWzHeQrtjpw.png",4,7

It is a foundation for machine learning, artificial intelligence and a more autonomic enterprise.rpatools.org • ShareEducation and lifelong learning will be crucial to allow workers to retrain in areas where jobs will likely be creates in the years to come, and where tasks are at low risk of automation.rpatools.org • ShareGoal: Kraft wanted to increase the automated test coverage of its core business processes from 50% to 80% to improve its defect detection rate and reduce test cycle time and effort.Outcome: Decreased the number of defects in production, achieved the goal of 80% automation, and significantly reduced the time and effort spent on manual script development, testing, and maintenance.rpatools.org • ShareLow cost Robotics could enable Small Businesses to Automate. Automation is expensive. But what if a low cost solution, that is quick to construct and implement into the production line could be utilized? This would enable many small businesses to take the next Industry 4.0 step.rpatools.org • ShareMany financial institutions are investing to deploy robotic and intelligent process automation (RPA/IPA), and we think they’re right to do so. But few are devoting the same kind of energy to address the people issues that arise when bringing this new technology on board. Getting this wrong can add risk, increase costs, and hurt your firm’s reputation. We’ve identified six steps that firms can take to manage the change and reap the full benefits of RPA.rpatools.org • ShareResearch shows that leading CFOs play a dual role in the digital transformations taking place in their companies. The first is to transform the finance function itself and the second is to drive the agenda across the company to ensure everything is tied to enhancing shareholder value.rpatools.org • ShareRPA Tools | It’s More Than Automation----RPA BlogThis is the Ownership Economy, and beyond being a positive social endeavor, the platforms building it are able to leverage incentives. https://jsk.transistor.fmJonathan KoganinOwnership Economy--Jonathan KoganinRPA Blog--Jonathan KoganinRPA Blog--Jonathan KoganinOwnership Economy--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Jonathan Kogan,https://medium.com/@theownershipeconomy,"7, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*2hUvQrrAfWx4yNnv.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*T0vvtQ61LslEtVlj.gif",3,0

O maior evento sobre inovação, tecnologia e entretenimento pro consumidor.",None,"Junimba SimõesFollow--ShareQuando um amigo alemão me disse que ao mudar pra Alemanha eu iria ver coisas que eu nem sabia que existiam, ele devia estar falando da IFA Berlim 2019! A Feira que começou como a German Radio Show, tem em sua história, ser responsável por mostrar os primeiros modelos de Rádio para Albert Einstein, que proferiu o seguinte discurso na abertura da Feira, em 1930:""O rádio deve cumprir uma função especial e única para a reconciliação internacional. Até agora, os povos se conheciam quase apenas com a ajuda do espelho distorcido de sua própria imprensa diária. O rádio mostra um ao outro na sua forma mais vívida e principalmente do seu lado amigável. Assim, contribuirá para acabar com o sentimento de estranheza bilateral que tão facilmente se transforma em desconfiança e hostilidade.""Albert Einstein no discurso de abertura da 7ª edição do German Radio Show (1930), atual IFA — Consumer Electronic Unlimited.Assim como eu, Einstein também não estava preparado para o que estava por vir...Pra começar, a Feira é ENORME e se intitula o ‘Parceiro Oficial do Futuro’ e este ano contou com mais de 1.800 expositores e 250 mil visitantes ávidos pelos mais modernos e inovadores produtos para (talvez) melhorar a sua vida.Paralelamente (e com preço diferenciado) acontecia o Shift Automotive, que discutia o futuro da mobilidade, tendo como foco a Indústria Automobilística, desesperada atrás das respostas pra onde vamos?! Também não sei, mas tomara que seja sem carro! :-) Então a Feira é bem abrangente e visa atender à vários segmentos de público, sempre com foco no consumidor. E é isso que me trouxe até aqui e que compartilho com você agora.Meu pai sofre desse problema e o D Free é o primeiro dispositivo para vestir (wearable) que promete ‘empoderar as pessoas com incontinência urinária a viver sem preocupações’. Através de um sensor preso ao corpo, na altura da bexiga (com adesivo comprado em separado), ele é capaz de monitorar e avisar a hora certa de ir ao banheiro e diminuindo também assim o consumo de fraldas.No caso de cuidadores ou enfermeiros, ele é capaz de acompanhar vários pacientes ao mesmo tempo, fazendo diminuir também o estresse entre cuidadores e pacientes. Pra uso particular, eu sugeri esquecer a conexão com o celular e colocar uma chave mecânica com 3 níveis no dispositivo. Tipo tanque de gasolina, pois é capaz do meu pai colocar a culpa no celular descarregado por ter mijado nas calças! Quem diria, a tecnologia te ajudando até na hora de dar daquela mijada.Inicialmente pensei que era tipo uma lanterna-óculos para ajudar na leitura da vista cansada, mas depois descobri que o Luminette serve pra melhorar o sono, levantar o ânimo natural do corpo e afastar o Coisa Ruim: o Inverno Alemão! Com uma linha de LED azulada que acende sobre a vista, ele promete após o uso de 20 a 45 minutos por dia, trazer a sensação de rejuvenescimento perdida em apenas 5 dias! E diz que devolve o seu dinheiro em até 30 dias se isso não acontecer. Quase comprei logo 3!Se até eu estou aqui ‘blogando’, imagina um cara lá do Piauí?! Hoje em dia com as possibilidades e recursos de câmeras disponíveis, algo que você só conseguiria investindo muito dinheiro há bem pouco tempo atrás, um paraíso de traquitanas para não deixar você perder nenhum momento está à sua inteira disposição por algumas poucas centenas de Euro. Não faltam soluções.Buscando a naturalidade dos movimentos e diminuir também a curva de aprendizado, o Drone Shift traz no seu joystick a sua grande novidade. Intitulado o 'Pequeno Perfeito', seu joystick intuitivo funciona através de um anel preso ao polegar, sendo possível controlar o voo de maneira muito simples e natural. Veja a demonstração que filmei aqui.Acho que a mania de ser centro do universo no mundo moderno ampliou bastante este mercado que está tornando cada vez mais fácil capturar imagens em 360 graus e parece também expandir para além da GoPro.A Insta360 TITAN é destinada a criação de conteúdo áudio-visual de primeira linha. Filmando em até 11K 3D VR ela é ideal para a criação de conteúdo para Tour Virtual, VR (Realidade Virtual) Livestream, Google Street View e tudo o mais que você quiser inventar em 360º! Ela conta ainda com estabilizador de imagem e captura de áudio também em 360º. Coisa séria!A Obsbot é ‘a câmera do futuro pro hoje’ e se diz uma câmera com inteligência artificial e tipo ‘3 em 1’. Capaz de te seguir (tracking), fazer auto-zoom e ser controlada por gestos. Tornando você ator e diretor ao mesmo tempo do seu filme. Spielberg perde!Junimba não escreveu uma linha sobre bike ainda nesse artigo?! Não é possível! Pois é, se você chegou até aqui e assim como eu, é apaixonado por bikes! Essa é a seção que você vai gostar mais! Claro que vejo bikes em todo lugar e na IFA Berlim não seria diferente.A Garmin é sem dúvida referência e até sinônimo de GPS pelo mundo e aproveitou o evento para mostrar toda a sua linha de produtos. Confesso que eu acho que a empresa está muito atrás no que diz respeito a usabilidade de seus produtos e têm enfrentado forte concorrência com opções mais fáceis de usar como é o caso da Wahoo, que aliás não estava presente na Feira e que infelizmente, também não cheguei a vê-la na Eurobike. Não vi novidades por aqui. Mais do mesmo.Eu não costumo pedalar de fones. Acho que o esporte já é perigoso suficiente para se distrair ouvindo música, mas a linha de produtos da AfterShokz, como o wireless Aeropex e o MP3 player à prova d'água XTrainerZ, prometem música pro seu treino sem que você perca a capacidade de audição espacial, graças a transmissão do som através de condução óssea. Ao invés de colocar o plug dentro do ouvido, ele fica fora da orelha e você ouve através da vibração do som nos seus ossos da face e do ouvido.Os capacetes de ciclismo, principalmente os destinados a lazer, estão vivendo uma fase de tentar encaixar conveniências e tecnologia aliada a segurança. Modelos como os da alemã Baabali, que se diz líder no mercado de capacetes inteligentes, vêm com luzes dianteiras e traseiras com pisca e conexão Bluetooth com saídas de som e microfone embutidos na estrutura do capacete.Já a Livall diz 'redefinir sua segurança' com o capacete Bling Helmet BH62 que possui detector de acidente, microfone que conta com redução de ruído de vento, botão SOS, função Walkie-Talkie, além do comando de voz. Mas já aviso logo que nenhum deles é Eurostyle! :-)Nunca fui a Lituânia, mas a marca Sponge de lá parece fazer um belo trabalho no desenvolvimento de produtos que unam tecnologia e praticidade. Na feira eles apresentaram, dentre outros produtos, a e-bike Sponge City, de desenho bem peculiar, eu a achei bem divertida. Veja o seu vídeo promocional aqui.Percorrendo a Feira também dei de cara com a Haibike XDURO ALLMTN 8.0 FlyOn, equipada com um sistema de cockpit integrado premiado pelo UX Design Awards e desenvolvido para tornar fácil todas as interação do ciclista com os comandos da bike através do seu um ciclo computador acoplado. A Garmin deveria beber mais dessa água aqui.Se você tem medo de voar de avião, não aconselho tentar 'voar' no Ícaros. Um aparelho que mistura ginástica e realidade virtual (VR) e ganhou o Red Dot Awards 2018. O que ele chama de Active VR, permiti fazer exercícios combinados com a sensação de voar em realidade virtual. Uma traquitana e tanto que espero você tenha espaço suficiente na sua sala para colocar o bichão.A febre dos scooters, também conhecido como patinetes elétricos é mundial e não faltaram opções e modelos espalhados por diversos estandes da IFA Berlin 2019 para conferir.A Segway que inventou o primeiro patinete de auto-balanço, sucesso no mundo todo, juntou-se a chinesa Ninebot em 2015 e desde então atendem pelo nome de Segway-Ninebot e juntas, têm ampliado o desenvolvimento de produtos para o transporte pessoal com invenções que unem mobilidade elétrica, mobile internet e interação homem-protótipo, visando ser a líder mundial em prover soluções de mobilidade robótica.O que mais me chamou atenção foi o modelo robótico Loomo, que é uma espécie de robozinho particular que te leva pra passear! Ele interage, te segue, conversa, tira fotos e faz filmes seus. Parece saído do desenho dos Jetsons.Existem ainda o Ninebot S e o Ninebot S-Plus que são a evolução do modelo original que consagrou a marca e trazem um desenho simplificado onde você 'dirige' com os joelhos. Todos ainda em pré-venda.A empresa ainda apresentou o Ninebot Gokart Kit que é um kit para divertir a garota! Ele se encaixa no Ninebot S2 e se transforma num mini kart irado, ganhador do prêmio Red Dot Award em Design Concept.Mas divertido mesmo é este que parece ser o patins do século XXI: O Segway Drift W1. Duas plataformas elétricas, que funcionam com o mesmo princípio básico dos Segways: Inclinou pra frente, vai pra frente, pra trás, vai pra trás. Fiz um test-drive e até que não fiz feio não. Achei muito divertido!Numa Feira como essa, esses que já foram os 'supra-sumos' da tecnologia e do consumo, parecem não chamar mais tanta atenção. Talvez por que já tenham chegado a um teto de desenvolvimento. Muitos computadores, laptops e mesmo marcas, parecem copiar a Apple e muitas vezes você até confunde mesmo.A Apple não estava presente no evento! Diferentemente de Microsoft, Asus, Samsung, LG e muitas outras.Atualmente a rede 5G já funciona em aplicações industriais e de grandes redes de computadores, mas aqui na Alemanha, 5 cidades já operam com a nova rede: Berlin, Colônia, Munique, Bonn e Darmstadt já possuem transmissões de banda larga acima de 1GB/s! A T-Mobile aproveitou o evento para lançar um super estande promovendo a novidade e trouxe até o Thomas Muller, jogador do Bayer de Munique e da Seleção Alemã pro debate. Esse pessoal de evento inventa cada uma… :-)E TVs? Bem…as TVs agora são 8K! Escondem os fios, são muito finas e se integram ao ambiente tentando se passar por uma obra de arte na parede. O destaque especial ficou por conta da linha LG Signature com a incrível TV OLED R de tela em rolo que como uma tela de projeção, enrola pra dentro do seu 'rack' e que chamou bastante atenção dos visitantes, realizando um verdadeiro show de sobe e desce.Pude experimentar uma aplicação bem divertida com holograma da Aska3D e também de um outro tipo da Infanity 3D, que cria as imagens holográficas através da rotação de uma espécie de hélice com 180 LEDs que ao rodar em alta velocidade, produz interessantes imagens holográficas. Vale conferir!Não é de hoje que esse tema nos fascina. Os primeiros 'robôs' que surgiram no mundo foram os pianos automáticos! Inventado por Edward Leveaux em 1876, eles continuam até hoje fascinando as pessoas. Na IFA Berlim 2019, no stand da Yamaha, essa velha invenção foi apresentada de um jeito diferente e criativo. No piano e também na bateria.Se você fica muito tempo fora de casa ou vai viajar e não tem com quem deixar o seu Rasga-Sofá…que tal comprar um robôzinho pra ele?! O Varram Pet Robot é uma divertida e curiosa invenção também saída do Kickstarter, que vai brincar e alimentar o seu pet de forma automática e totalmente customizada via celular! É capaz de você nem mais lembrar que tem cachorro depois disso! Mas tenho lá minhas dúvidas se funciona com gatos. :-)Imagina um bichinho que não te dá trabalho? Não suja a casa? Não rasga o sofá? Não incomoda os vizinhos? Não late! Não mia! Mas que balança sempre o rabo com o seu carinho. Não come ração, não gasta o seu dinheiro! Não precisa de veterinário! E muito menos vai te fazer levantar de madruga pra levá-lo na praça pra fazer xixi. 'Ninguém merece', diria minha irmã.Pois é! Pra resolver também esse 'problema', chegou o Qoobo! O seu próximo ‘bichinho’ de estimação! Olhando rápido, você vai achar que é uma almofada com rabo. E você quase acertou! Mas é muito mais que isso.Claro que ele só podia ser coisa de japonês! E reflete talvez a consequência de uma sociedade muito conectada e ao mesmo tempo só. Sem tempo até mesmo para cuidar dos nossos bichinhos de estimação. O pet do futuro, já é vendido no Japão e está em fase de pré-venda na Amazon, mas já pode ser comprado por US$ 149 no Shopify da Qoobo. Não duvido que se torne um sucesso.> Veja aqui o filme que fiz do 'bichinho' durante a IFA Berlim 2019.Pra quem brincou de ser DJ na tenra juventude como eu, sabe o que significa o relançamento da mais clássica, importante e parte da história da música e de seus equipamentos: a Technics SL-1200 G! Carinhosamente chamada também de MK2, esse toca-discos é usado por 10 entre cada 10 DJs ao redor do Mundo até hoje! Foi lançado no início dos anos 70 e rapidamente adotado por boates e aficionados da música devido a sua precisão, força, durabilidade e qualidade de reprodução. Atualmente era praticamente uma relíquia e após quase 30 anos, a Technics (hoje subsidiária da Panasonic) a traz de volta para a linha de montagem. Uma edição especial lançada no Japão em 2016, foi toda vendida em apenas 30 minutos! Vida longa a MK2!Para continuar acompanhando, siga-me no Twitter.Fim.----My BlogJunimba SimõesinCyclingCircus--Junimba SimõesinColecionando Berlim--Junimba Simões--Junimba Simões--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Junimba Simões,https://medium.com/,"25, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*yAPC1mnn9MZ-_f2ebNARaA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*AVRYD34K7zuiaq597em-UQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*sw0zMBVr4FANe-VJwIMEEw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*sON7RcVQqe3IClah.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Gv4UPuNw4ucsiiA6tlspLQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*psX1wSQdd1Tt_-tLbS86zQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*DorwY2gZLd6YG-n3cVPnjQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*sNTaLsnp4iZZ5mcsHCqjaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*N_z_P3NxkKP-wP4v21Nr0A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*dB1_GJ9f6Faju6aYveoiCA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*svSXu43RDrTdMHOvl1FF1Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8rOTMMJ34r7I5NjlEurnaA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*97T4H39YWSq3_2PpuntiCg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vAQ0OvTQEpMEhd_eV7zo2g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hzbszmqcs-tOEELXYGcKXw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fhm_vBKbksXUhHvJC9WtXA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*TaFpsf9zlQOWvhsLMF_NCg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1HoBe1hhpI8okzoNH9ePpg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VM0uYtXMzlW0yygQkkxxjg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fwiJzW4PlufhGajmySeeVw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*WU9T--BG1E9gNnNbpJ__dg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Bk_FJWpLP6eQA8Mp4_NePQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*f0n23LHgqKIolhXxIr56uw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*RwO_yYfb9dn291WRWULpsw.png",12,78

However, this process has resulted in a spectacularly high failure rate. Recent studies indicate that less that 10 percent of drugs entering clinical trials receive FDA approval — and that success rate is even lower for chemotherapeutics. Why do so many drugs, particularly chemotherapies, fail in clinical trials?One significant weakness in the development pipeline is the preclinical data used to determine whether a specific drug warrants a clinical trial. This crucial evidence usually comes from small animal studies — in other words, the mouse. Laboratory mice live extremely well-controlled lives: Their diets and environments are sterilized and standardized. Their light exposure and temperature are carefully regulated. Mice in a study are the same age and are virtually indistinguishable genetically. All of this is intentional — it reduces the number of variables and confounding factors, simplifying data analysis. But does this decades-old system do more harm than good?In short, it might. Laboratory temperatures became a ‘hot’ topic recently after several groups demonstrated that tumor growth and responses to various chemotherapeutics, particularly immunotherapies, changed drastically when room temperatures were increased by seven degrees Centigrade. Other studies indicated that mice with natural gut microbes — produced by a varied diet that laboratory mice do not receive — better replicate human responses to therapies than their laboratory cousins. How can we improve on this system?The answer may be sitting right beside you! Our companion animals are exposed to same environments we are — car exhaust, lawn care chemicals, household cleaners, pizza on weekends — and develop many of the same diseases. They are genetically diverse, with natural gut microbes and immune systems from a life lived outside the laboratory. Not surprisingly, our companion animals often respond to medical therapies in much the same way we do. Clinical trials in these animals benefit both humans and animals. The creation of unique ‘integrated comparative clinical trials’ promises to accelerate progress in veterinary and human medicine.Integrated comparative clinical trials have two distinct differences when compared to traditional clinical trials: They consist of human and companion animal (usually dog) studies running in parallel, and they are iterative. These trial designs are particularly beneficial in diseases which are more common in dogs than in humans (e.g., osteosarcoma), and diseases with poor mouse models (e.g., glioblastoma). Drugs can be rapidly screened in dogs, and the most promising candidates are quickly translated to human clinical trials. Information gathered from the human trial is then applied to further studies in dogs, creating an iterative feedback loop that benefits both species — the ‘virtuous cycle’ of comparative medicine.The diversity and complexity of tumors that occur naturally in our companion animals cannot be replicated in the artificial environment of the laboratory, and access to canine patients has enabled the study of complex biological pathways. For example, our immune systems are so individualized that predicting responses to immunotherapies can be difficult. A combination of two immunotherapies, Interleukin-2 and -12, was evaluated in dogs, and the results informed human trials. Precision medicine — the practice of tailoring treatments to a specific patient using genetic information — has also received a boost from comparative trials, since it relies on genetic variations not seen in lab-grown tumors. These integrated comparative clinical trials have been supported by various entities, including the One Health Initiative, the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium, and the Canine Comparative Oncology & Genomics Consortium. The work from these organizations has been transformative for both veterinary and human medicine.The Focused Ultrasound Foundation is interested in integrated comparative clinical trials, and has funded several comparative trials to treat cancers like sarcoma, melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma that affect both dogs and humans.Additional Resources:Veterinary ProgramFocused Ultrasound Foundation Launches Veterinary ProgramFoundation Funds Veterinary Clinical TrialsRead this blog on our website.Kelsie Timbie, PhD, is the Scientific Programs Manager and the Veterinary Program Director at the Focused Ultrasound Foundation.----We strive to improve the lives of millions of people with serious medical disorders by accelerating the development and adoption of focused ultrasound.Focused Ultrasound Foundation--Focused Ultrasound Foundation--Focused Ultrasound Foundation--Focused Ultrasound Foundation--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Focused Ultrasound Foundation,https://medium.com/@FUSFoundation,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*17IkJcyw2W_jvjveomHuHw.png",3,1

Öncelikle github’ı rahat bir şekilde anlayabilmek için git kavramını da anlamanız gerekiyor.Git , yazdığımız projeleri ve uygulamaları, bilgisayarımızda ya da harici disklerde değilde internet üzerinde tutmamızı ve yönetmemizi sağlayan bir versiyon kontrol sistemidir.Bir yazılım projesi hangi dil ile kodlanırsa kodlansın zamanla versiyonlandırma’ya ihtiyaç duyar peki versiyonlandırma nasıl yapılır bizlerde yazılım dünyasındaki bu versiyonlara pekte yabancı değiliz. Uygulamaların sonundaki v1.5, v5.5 gibi ifadelere aşinasınızdır diye tahmin ediyorum buna örnek vermek gerekirse ;Şimdi aklınızda az çok bir şeyler oluşmuştur diye tahmin ediyorum. Versiyon numarası nasıl yapılır ; yazılımcının projesinde yaptığı değişiklikler,çıkarmalar,eklemelerin hepsini bir versiyon olarak kaydederler. Git burada devreye girer. Sizin projenizde yaptığınız değişiklikleri,eklemeleri,çıkarmaların hepsini kayıt etmektedir. Siz bu güncellemelere kolayca ulaşabilir, düzenleyebilirsiniz. Bu tanımı daha kısa bir şekilde açıklayacak olur isek, git sürüm kontrol sistemidir. Diğer iyi yanı da yapmış olduğunuz değişiklikleri başkaları görebilir üzerinde değişiklikler yapabilir ve paylaşabilir. Git açık kaynak kodlu bir yazılımdır.Git’i seçmeniz için bir çok neden vardır. Diğer platformlara göre daha çok avantajı bulunmaktadır. Dosya değişikliklerini daha düzgün ve verimli depolar.Öncelikle github’u nerede kullanacağımızı bilir isek daha doğru hareket ederiz. Github’u takım çalışmalarında kullanabilirsiniz. Oluşturduğunuz projeye yeni kişiler ekleyerek proje ortağı bulma işine dahada kolaylaştırabilirsiniz.Eğer Git, GitHub’ın kalbiyse, Hub da onun ruhudur. GitHub’daki hub ise komut satırını, Git gibi, geliştiriciler için en büyük sosyal ağa çevirendir.Belirli bir projeye katkı sağlamanın dışında GitHub kullanıcılarına kendileri gibi hemfikir insanlarla sosyalleşme olanağı sağlar. İnsanları takip edebilir ve ne yaptıklarını veya kimle bağlantı kurduklarını izleyebilirsiniz.Çoğu yazılımcının size şu öğütü verdiğinizi duymuşsunuzdur. Başkalarının yazdığı kodları incelemek istiyorsanız github tam size göre. Burada kodlama dili fark etmez istediğiniz kodlama dilini aratmanız yeterli olacaktır. Kendi kodlarınızı da test edebilirsiniz, başkalarına meydan okuyabilirsiniz.GitHub, git teknolojisine ev sahipliği yapan bir girişimdir.

129,11504,https://medium.com/eleven01-blog/indias-native-blockchain-protocol-670d44297b24?source=tag_archive---------83-----------------------,Why India Needs a Native Blockchain Protocol,None,"Eleven01FollowEleven01--ListenShareHow can India benefit from Blockchain and the maximization of a native blockchain protocol?The world’s largest democracy is marching towards digitization. Ever since Arun Jaitley, the Finance Minister of India spoke about blockchain technology in his budget speech in March 2018, the distributed ledger technology has found itself to be the centre of attention among industry leaders and governments alike.Because of its immutability, blockchain has been attracting the attention of governments all over the world. These government departments see valuable opportunities through this technology. With the transparency and the authenticity that blockchain brings, it is getting easier for participants to keep a check on the validity of data that is being presented to them.In India, it appears that the government, still figuring out the regulation around cryptocurrency, but is very interested in leveraging blockchain as a key technology component. In July 2018, the state of Rajasthan became the first in the country to have a fully developed blockchain-based fabric for managing electronic health records. This news came following the Kerala state government’s attempt at incorporating blockchain in the purchase and distribution network of vegetables, milk, and fish in the state.There is definitely a strong interest in employing blockchain from the government. However, India is not alone in this journey. Several other countries have already started using blockchain in governance and citizen-facing applications.Global vs LocalFrom a global standpoint, some initiatives that have truly stood out are as follows -The one thing that stands out here is that most countries that have successfully implemented blockchain PoCs have small populations and the applications implemented here do not have as much of need for speed and scale.That changes when it comes to India. With over 1.3 billion people, every service that will employ the blockchain will have high speed and scale requirements. Furthermore, India’s internet infrastructure, though vast, is not consistent across its geography. Majority of India’s mobile computing devices are also on the lower end of the spectrum.This is changing as we speak, but if blockchain is to address India’s problem now, customized base chains are a necessity.How can India benefit from blockchain?The Indian government has been keen on exploring the potential of blockchain in its governance domain with strong support coming from the honourable Prime Minister himself. The NITI Aayog is backing the government’s interest at the adoption and advocacy of the technology.For the sixth largest economy of the world, blockchain technology offers a several opportunities spread across many sectors. These pertain to areas of banking and finance, agriculture, education, employment, healthcare, voting, supply chain, retail, and even Goods and Services Tax (GST).For instance, the Indian healthcare industry lacks a robust infrastructure to securely store large amounts of data. It is one of the largest sectors with revenues expected to touch 120 billion USD by 2020. An industry of this scale comes with huge data repositories hosting sensitive information about patients.A distributed database gives us an opportunity to store all of the patients’ data securely and efficiently. With blockchain, all the stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem such as doctors, laboratories, hospitals can have real-time access to a patient’s data thus saving time on critical decision making and improving overall efficiencies of the whole system. The state government of Rajasthan, has started implementing such a project as a first in India.Blockchain technology would also make it easier to implement multiple government initiatives efficiently from the beginning. For instance, The Ayushman Bharat initiative, announced by the government of India in 2018, aims to have a far-reaching impact on the Indian healthcare landscape by incorporating IT enablement, data analytics and management of fraud, among other things, in healthcare. It aims at providing efficient healthcare facilities to more than 10 crore rural and urban families. With assistance from the blockchain, the implementation of the biggest government-sponsored healthcare scheme in the world especially with respect to fraud management can be successfully achieved.The same goes for the education sector where it is getting harder by the day to differentiate fake degrees from the real ones. In January 2018, Delhi police busted a fake degree racket operation which had sold more than 50,000 forged mark sheets of both school and university levels.The state medical council of Maharashtra, in September 2018, pressed charges against 58 doctors for submitting fake degrees to obtain a practising license.In scenarios like these, a digital certificate based on blockchain wherein the degrees are issued on a distributed ledger with a complete auditable trail visible to all stakeholders helps eliminate any fraud possibility.Blockchain technology also helps us in cases of EVM (electronic voting machines) tampering and allows us to keep voter’s information and identity secured using cryptography.Blockchain technology has also been employed to bring a change in cross-border payments (with faster transactions and minimal fees), supply chain management (with more transparency and enhanced security), and real estate (with shorter sales cycles and overhead costs).It is also useful in the much complex Good and Service Tax calculation where the nodes in a supply chain can calculate the GST suitably making for an incorruptible system.Today, blockchain technology is a key aspect of governance digitalization owing to the transparency that it brings into the system. Multiple citizen services (farmer subsidy, PM Aavaz Yojna, Ayushman Bharat) can be delivered efficiently to the beneficiaries because of the inherent benefits this technology brings with itself.In ideal government machinery, blockchain technology eradicates the scope of corruption and provides for an efficient system while enabling ease of doing business.The NITI Aayog is highly supportive of blockchain technology. As quoted by the CEO Mr Amitabh Kant, “NITI Aayog is applying Blockchain technology to pressing problems of India in areas such as land registry, health records, fertiliser subsidy distribution system, the menace of fraudulent drugs, agriculture supply chain. These disruptive projects will bring immense productive efficiency.”Blockchain enabling an interoperable ecosystemBlockchain technology will create a single shared ledger containing untampered data which everyone will be able to access. This would not only enable communication between different data repositories but also uniformity in their storage and security infrastructure.Blockchain implementation will potentially establish a connection between all the domains of the government and will ensure efficiency, transparency, and improved governance.A native, homegrown protocol — Eleven01New use cases for blockchain are being developed every day. This is because most countries have access to a blockchain protocol that has been developed and bred in their native technologies (China has NEO; Korea Icon etc). But there has been no native blockchain protocol from India. Blockchain is a very key block on the digital backbone of any country, more so India, which has a large population and most of them have a digital presence, identity and information about their daily life and transactions. Coupled with Aadhar, India’s own social-security card, blockchain together is critical for any country. And it will need to ensure its highly secure and built and managed at a grass root level rather than relying on foreign systems and solution, which will always be a threat to security fabric.With local requirements for data sovereignty, privacy and security in mind, The Eleven01 Foundation is developing India’s first ever home-grown blockchain protocol to enable the smooth progression and adoption of blockchain technology across the country.A major domain where India can make use of blockchain is data storage and privacy issues. The country took a step towards having its own data privacy framework after Srikrishna Committee made several recommendations relating a data protection law. India has nearly 600 million internet users and it only makes sense for the country to have a framework that can protect their data from being exploited. Blockchain can potentially be of assistance here with its novel storage solutions changing the way data is stored wherein users get to decide who accesses their data.A country as vast as India needs a protocol that has been developed by someone who understands the Indian customers and the Indian system of doing things — a protocol that accommodates the Indian diversity and establishes a country-wide blockchain ledger which can act as an accelerator in bringing the government initiatives closer to the people.The Eleven01 ProtocolThe Eleven01 protocol is a public and private blockchain to bring blockchain technologies to the next billion people. It is being built and developed with India focus and needs and provides an infrastructure to build fast, scalable, and flexible operations for various industry verticals and digitization of real-world assets.The Eleven01 protocol will be developed with oracles which make it possible to transfer critical existing data onto blockchain and keeping the non-critical data off the chain while maintaining the integrity of blockchain thus resulting in improved speed of the system. Moreover, the Eleven01 protocol is a flexible protocol where the privacy settings can be altered and a consensus algorithm can be chosen depending on the type of use case being worked on.Despite the crash in market valuation of cryptocurrencies, these are exciting times for blockchain technology and its applications as there are numerous advances being made to solve the inherent challenges of this new technology. With Eleven01, India is well positioned to harness the benefits of this transformative technology and become a leading player on a global stage.----Eleven01The world’s largest blockchain ecosystem, built around India’s only blockchain protocolEleven01inEleven01--Eleven01inEleven01--2Eleven01inEleven01--1Eleven01inEleven01--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Henrique CentieiroinDataDrivenInvestor--2Unbecoming--768PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Jeffrey ScholzinRareSkills--1Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Eleven01,https://medium.com/@eleven01,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*H6OclwgvBnJk8aMyPswizQ.png",7,5

A physical presence for an invisible currency.,None,"Thomas ReadFollow--ListenShareBitcoin has brought about a curiously amusing natural phenomenon to all of us with it’s unpredictably bizarre price fluctuations & rapidly growing popularity. Its quite common now to hear the topic of cryptocurrencies come up in your everyday conversations with family and friends. The bitcoin network has created worldwide controversy & a whole new digital way for people to exchange for goods & services over the internet. Its seen as a store of value by many, and its even been compared side by side with gold.Bitcoin has managed to gain worldwide attention from just about everyone, yet nobody knows who its real creator is, and no single entity controls bitcoin, rather the bitcoin network is collectively run by it’s network nodes (miners) working together as a whole system. Bitcoin is a decentralized blockchain, one that has successfully been immune to hacking, and also impossible to counterfeit with its finite 21 million bitcoin supply.There are ATMs all over the world used to exchange paper fiat currencies, but now there’s ones for crypto, too. Since 2014 Bitcoin ATM’s have started sprouting up across the globe at an exponential rate. There are currently over 15 thousand deployed across the world on this day, July 29th 2019.These Bitcoin ATM’s, or BTM’s as some refer to them, have eye appeal and stand out, much like the virtual currencies that muse their somewhat obsessed “HODLers.”If you wanted to, you could even start your own BTM Business, many operators I’ve interacted with from a business standpoint have come in all shapes and sizes. I’ve seen just about every kind of business structure in this industry so far from a legit tiered departmental organization, to a husband and wife, or a close group of friends running their own BTM business together. It may sound easy when I put it that way, but in reality there is a lot more to this that meets the eye, and it is progressively getting harder to operate with strict regulatory pressure.The essential ingredients to have a thriving (and legal) Bitcoin ATM network of your own are far but just a few. Of course you need to have a eye catching branding and user friendly software synced with the bitcoin network, but really the most important factor is compliance. You need to be compliant with the SEC Regulations and New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), register with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FINCEN & successfully Implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) oversight.After you’ve followed all the correct procedures you need to develop a strategy to get your BTMs deployed, online, and maintained. (that last sentence is something that I can help you with, stay with me here) Once you have all that down you just need a support team to help manage your machines & ensure you comply with regulators, an ethical finance team to ensure the currency is accounted for, and you also need to be pretty tight with BRINKS or other armored money transport companies, because you’re going to be dealing not only with bitcoin, but with cold hard cash, and lots of it!My company Granite Telecommunications provides the internet connectivity for many operators of these BTM’s Nationwide. We provide top of the line Cradlepoint Routers & give you the most reliable LTE connectivity based on the geographical region you intend on placing that machine. Granite gets you access to the 4 major cellular networks in the US, & 2 major cellular networks in Canada. Our solution comes with a rock solid team for support, the option to install all of your BTM machines, and an industry leading internet solution that comes with device management software. Its the ideal solution to help you manage your network with reliable internet connectivity, and a vast network with thousands of techs across North America to help you scale quickly.

Although at the start of this generation Xbox one wasn’t your go to console but things changed drastically around the end of 2016, Project Scorpio was announced(which would later be named Xbox One X) and Xbox One S was also released in August 2016.Xbox One S is basically the original Xbox One but this one had inbuilt power brick and was a bit slimmer. However, this One S comes with 4k upscaling in gameplay and also has a 4k DVD player.Xbox One X was released at the end of 2017 and is the best console graphics wise, having native 4k gameplay.So in 2019, Xbox is holding up pretty good. Games look good on this system, Game Pass being an additional benefit, plus the price of Xbox One S now is quite low. If someone wants to get into the gaming world, my advice would to go with Xbox One S, as it’s less expensive and with Game Pass subscription, you would have access to over 250 games instantly.Game Pass is basically Netflix of games. Here, you pay a monthly fee to access all the games, you download the games on your system and play, till you have an active subscription. Once your subscription expires, you can’t play those games, however the game, progress and achievements will be saved. You can also share your digitally purchased games and your memberships with one friend by adding his console as home Xbox on your console.Also, the backwards compatibility is something which shouldn’t be missed. So, there’s a list of backwards compatible OG Xbox and Xbox 360 games which you can play on your Xbox One, simply inserting the compatible disk and downloading the game. It’s actually a kind of emulator that plays games but you need the disk in disk drive because one disk one console. Digitally purchased games can be transferred by logging into your live account on the Xbox one and then downloading them.So, Xbox One is holding up pretty well in 2019, they have the most powerful machine, a cheaper machine, backwards compatibility and of course, Game Pass. So, if you don’t own a console of current generation and would like to have one, should go for Xbox One. However, E3 being around the corner and current generation being 6 years old, we might get a new console around 2020–21.Till then, One S.----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Lakshya Khatri,https://medium.com/@lakshya.khatri264,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*0OH81jM2WFFzOT64UMaRNA.jpeg",2,26

137,48676,https://medium.com/charlottes-digital-web/why-great-developers-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome-d892c07b4c72?source=tag_archive---------81-----------------------,Why great developers suffer from imposter syndrome,None,"Charlotte BoneFollowCharlotte’s Digital Web--ListenShareI remember when I first heard the term imposter syndrome at a conference and it was a real revelation for me; in a room full of hundreds of talented lead developers, only a handful had never experienced this.Imposter syndrome is essentially the feeling that you’re not good enough and you’ve got to where you have by accident. It sounds ridiculous when you say that; how could you have faked years of experience and delivering great projects? But it’s a very real feeling.The thing I’ve learnt during my time in industry, is that imposter syndrome is usually the sign of a great developer. A developer can never know everything, technology is constantly changing, there are multiple correct ways to solve problems and we’re surrounded by people who know things that we don’t. A developer that thinks that they know everything isn’t usually someone that you want to work with.Although imposter syndrome usually means a person is aware that they need to keep learning, it can also really hold people back. I’ve had friends who are amazing developers that I’ve really looked up to tell me that they fear interviews and that they don’t think they’re good enough for roles. It’s not simply a confidence thing either, as these are people who are really confident when they’re working on projects. It’s the awareness that people will know more than you on particular topics.So how can we overcome this feeling? I’m not sure we can ever overcome it completely, it’s the price we pay for being in an industry surrounded by really intelligent people and endless things to learn. One thing that’s really helped me over the years though is to embrace the knowledge of others, learn from them and you’ll find that they also learn from you. I remember years ago doing pair programming for the first time in a large company and I was terrified because I thought I’d look stupid in front of them. In the end we had great fun and we learnt from each other.Tell your colleagues and friends that they are great, go to them for help when they know something you don’t and don’t be afraid of someone being better than you. A collaborative environment is far better than a competitive environment that just exacerbates imposter syndrome.----Charlotte’s Digital WebI am a creative, passionate, full stack developer.

Our plan is to regularly update the tech and recruiting communities here on Medium with new CodeSubmit features as they become available. We are a customer-centered company, so user feedback plays a leading role in determining which features we pursue for the CodeSubmit platform. So, if you’re using our platform and you have a suggestion, we want to hear it! Just reach out at hello@codesubmit.io.Without further ado, here are our newest features, now live on the CodeSubmit platform:Invite Candidates with LinkIn our MVP, it was only possible to invite candidates to respective take-home assignments in-app. To do that, you would go into the assignment, click the “Invite Candidate” button, add their name and email address, press send, and then the candidate would receive a CodeSubmit email, inviting them to the take-home assignment. One of our early users requested the ability to copy the invite link directly so that they could invite the candidate in their own email or ATS, believing that in some cases, this method provides a smoother flow of information between hiring team and candidate. So, we are excited to announce that Invite Candidates with a Link functionality is now available, in addition to the original “Invite Candidate” button.Manage Hiring TeamOur third feature is called Manage Hiring Team. This button allows you to add additional CodeSubmit users to a specific take-home assignment as a subscriber. Subscribers receive email notifications about candidate progress for that specific assignment, ensuring that everyone involved in the hiring process stays informed when a candidate progresses through an assignment stage.In-App NotificationsIn addition to email notifications, CodeSubmit now includes in-app notifications to keep you on top of recent activity that is important to you. These notifications will inform you of all activity that has taken place in the assignments you’re subscribed to since the last time you logged in. It also provides a history of activity for all assignments that you care about, should you need that information later on. Our new mascot ROBert will let you know when you’re all caught up!Sign Up or Sign In with GoogleFinally, we are happy to announce that CodeSubmit is now Google Sign In compatible! This was one of our most requested features from day one, and it’s great for companies who use G Suite in their businesses and may prefer that their employees use their G Suite account for all software services.We hope you’ve enjoyed our first-ever CodeSubmit Features Update! Thanks for reading! If you’re a tech recruiter or technical hiring manager, check out CodeSubmit.io, sign up for a free trial, and begin automating your take-home coding assignments!And before we go, we want to wish our LGBTQ+ Community a Happy Pride Month!----CodeSubmitCo-founder @ CodeSubmit.io | Maker, writer, former recruiterTracy PhillipsinCodeSubmit--Tracy PhillipsinCodeSubmit--Tracy PhillipsinCodeSubmit--Tracy PhillipsinCodeSubmit--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Tracy Phillips,https://medium.com/@tracy-phillips,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Rcu5iIot04T53CYhE02YTA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jaX4y7Mm1KOzlrYunbI5XA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-iv1lJV_FMY4YBOc17unmw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*lQN973AVtDdxZR9KfUcuFw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*WNtORBgef3a22OWKyXyV2Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zu7aQjpGANXzYHf9xZSGKg.png",3,8

Or maybe you’ve told your waiter you aren’t ready to order, but then don’t see them again for what feels like forever.What about that frustrating moment when your meal is done, the conversation has come to an end, and you’re ready to leave. And then.. BAM! You forgot to ask for the check. Then that check arrives and now you have to figure out who owes who what. Multiple credit cards? Cash? A combination of both? Venmo? We’ll circle back to these frustrations in a minute.People love restaurants. We’ve all gone out to eat. Restaurants are social landmarks — places where all sorts of emotions and conversations come to life. From date nights to business meetings, from family gatherings to networking events, from catching up with friends to getting that Happy Hour special, restaurants play an important role in all our lives.That’s why it’s no surprise that the restaurant industry’s projected sales for 2018 was $825 billion. People dine out more than ever before and it’s a beautiful thing. People’s love for restaurants empowered my grandmother to start her own, Babcha’s Pierogies, at 72 years old.Babcha’s Pierogies is your traditional sit-down restaurant, where guests are seated, orders are taken, food is served, and payment is transacted. We’ve dined this way since the 18th century. Today we have POS systems that help restaurants run more efficiently. But how efficient is it really?Here’s a rundown on the current process to order and pay at a sit-down restaurant:To order a meal, you communicate your order to the waiter, who then inputs your order into a machine (POS system), which relays your order to the kitchen. To pay for the meal, you notify the waiter, who goes to that same machine to print your check and deliver it to you. You provide either cash or credit, which the waiter takes back to the machine to process payment before returning back to you a second time. Finally, you leave a (hopefully generous) tip which requires the waiter to go back to the machine yet again.The reality of this process is quite clear — you’ll never not see a member of the waitstaff in front of the POS system during popular hours. While the waiter is running back and forth between your table and the POS system three times just to process payment, other people are waiting to order or pay as well.So what we’re getting at is this — restaurants are run inefficiently. This inefficiency leads to lost revenue for restaurants, who already face extremely tight margins. As for guests, this inefficiency leads to the frustrations outlined at the beginning of this post. Whereas we use our phones to pay for everything from Ubers to Airbnb’s to coffees at Starbucks to things on Amazon we really don’t need, we’re still painstakingly held back by the very traditional method of ordering and paying at sit-down restaurants.So what does TableTab do? We solve this pain, this two-sided inefficiency. When dining out, you can use our app to instantly pull up the restaurant’s menu, select which dish you want, and then order. Payment is done automatically. That’s it.We make ordering at restaurants as simple as ordering an Uber. We get payment done the very moment you place your order. No more having to wait to order or pay. You can leave as soon as you’re ready to go. No more having to calculate who owes who what or send Venmo requests — we eliminate that altogether. We save waitstaff hundreds of trips to the POS system and at the same time significantly increase their tip volume. We make modern dining at sit-down restaurants just that — modern.Guests get to control their dining experiences. Restaurants and waitstaff get to optimize their operations and make more money. It’s a win-win.Do you like eating out? Sign up to use TableTab when we launch this month!Make sure to follow us on Instagram, Facebook , or LinkedIn.

144,9816,https://medium.com/@codeorg/the-kids-want-this-four-reasons-why-you-should-teach-computer-science-5b469429b17f?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,‘The kids want this’: Four reasons why you should teach computer science,1. Your students really want to learn computer science.,"Code.orgFollow--ListenShareAt Code.org, we believe every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science as a foundational subject, just like biology, chemistry, or algebra. However, most schools still don’t offer a computer science class, in large part because there aren’t enough teachers to teach it.But why would you teach computer science? We were curious to hear from teachers who’ve participated in our professional learning program to begin teaching computer science. So we asked them, and a handful of themes emerged. Read on for their answers. And when you’re ready, we have full-ride scholarships available!Many teachers we heard from started offering computer science classes because their students were hungry for it.Ryan Murphy, a high school teacher from Louisiana, was tasked with teaching a CS course when 75 of his school’s 300 students requested it. Murphy, who teaches chemistry and science, dove in and took a professional learning workshop, then brought Code.org’s no-cost curriculum and materials back to the classroom. It was there he saw how deeply his students engaged with it. “It surprised me how quickly they gravitated toward the projects,” he says. “I’ve seen more humor and creativity than I have in any other context.”Like Murphy, Kyleigh Lewis discovered there was tremendous interest in computer science education at her small rural high school in Nebraska: 65 out of 200 total students enrolled in her CS course, including the children of school board members! She, too, was impressed with her students’ engagement. “It’s empowering to see [my students] create an answer, rather than just finding it in the book,” says Lewis.The research supports the enthusiasm from students: since 2013, computer science has become the 4th most popular STEM career, according to the ACT’s Conditions of STEM report. We’ve also found that students like computer science class more than schoolwork in general. In fact, computer science is the second most popular subject, behind the arts!Because computer science is a foundational subject for all 21st-century careers, access to it in K–12 is an equity issue the country needs to address.For Ryan Brown, a middle and high school teacher in Pennsylvania, bringing Code.org’s computer science curriculum into his classroom meant giving his students access to interests and career options they would not have otherwise had. “We’re an economically disadvantaged school,” he says, “so the emphasis on equity and access is great. I had a student who fought me tooth and nail when I was introducing him to the curriculum, and just got accepted into an internship program with Nest. He told me, ‘I’m so glad you got me to do this.’”At Code.org, access to and equity in computer science is a key focus and it’s central to how we approach professional learning. And thanks to teachers like Brown, we’re making progress. According to research conducted by West Coast Analytics, schools in the Code.org program see greater participation rates in CS Principles exams among female and underrepresented minority students:Those same Code.org students also pass the AP CS Principles exam at much higher rates, a result that directly reflects our teachers’ commitment to equity in the classroom.A strong sense of support and community is the most consistent takeaway for teachers in Code.org’s professional learning programs.For Renee Hanson, a middle-school teacher from Omaha, Nebraska, going to a workshop in Arizona felt a little like the first day at a new school. “I was thinking what am I doing here, I’m in a room full of computer science teachers and I don’t even know what computer science is,” she says. But almost immediately, she found she wasn’t the only one new to computer science. She also marveled at how accessible everyone seemed to be, a trend that’s continued even after the workshops.“No one was off limits, you could ask anyone anything at any time,” she says. “So I could say, and I did say, I don’t even know how to start.”Many of the teachers we’ve heard from were new to computer science, like Hanson. Teachers came with backgrounds in subjects like English and social studies, but at the workshops, many say they found the curriculum and tools easy to understand and to use. They also say their fellow learners and facilitators were accessible, open, and enthusiastic.We believe such diversity is beneficial, and the stats bear this out. Teachers from all backgrounds make great CS teachers, and student outcomes don’t suffer under Code.org teachers new to CS — in fact, they’re identical to student outcomes under teachers with a CS background!Again and again, teachers said that, while learning to teach computer science, they discovered teaching tools and methods they could use to engage their students in all of their classes.For Kyleigh Lewis, it was the ‘lead learner’ method, which involves shifting from being the source of knowledge to being a leader in seeking knowledge. “As a teacher,” she says, “I might not have the answer right away, but working with the gurus in your classroom, all the answers can be found.”Other teachers mentioned things like inquiry-based teaching, process wheels, and designated student experts. Many, like Jaime DiPierro, appreciated the role that frustration can play in the learning process, and the ways the workshops prepared them to manage it in their students. “Code.org does a good job of reminding you to encourage frustration,” says DiPierro, a high school teacher from Florida. “In this environment, frustration is good, it means that you’re learning. It’s developing [my students] into good problem solvers.”Students carry what they learn in computer science classes into other subject areas, too. That’s because Code.org’s curriculum emphasizes skills like critical thinking and problem-solving that transfer to nearly every subject area.There are a number of great reasons to teach computer science, and with Code.org’s professional learning programs, it’s so simple to get started. Just head to our professional learning page and choose your grade.This year, we’re offering a number of full-ride scholarships for our middle and high school workshops!

In the 15 years before that, though, I worked in the offices of my various employers. I spent the last five of those years at a windowless cubicle. When I went remote a few years ago, I set up my first proper home office. I touched upon that here, but I’ve since moved houses and upgraded my home office.It’s time for an update! Here’s my current home office.I’m a home-body and like being around my wife and kids, so I opted for a home office instead of a co-working space. The room I work from is my dedicated office, which IMO is really important because it helps maintain the line between personal and professional time.My office is located right off the front door and near the kitchen. I was initially worried about having my office in a high traffic area, especially since the doors are glass, but it turned out to be a non-issue. The house is big enough that I’m not on top of anyone else and I can close the door when I need privacy. My family usually honors the open/closed door policy, though there are exceptions 👧.I have a standing desk, chair, and upright mouse which helps with my RSI and health in general. I change my standing vs. sitting position every hour or two throughout the day. The rest is fairly basic: A MacBook Pro with a couple external monitors and backup hard drive.Protip: When everyone’s home and streaming Netflix and whatnot, my internet speed sometimes starts to lag. Video calls are a big part of my day and Fiber isn’t available in my area, so when WiFi isn’t fast enough I plug in an ethernet cable using this dongle.My personal computer is in the same room. I keep my work life and personal life pretty well separated, so things like my music and personal email live exclusively on my personal computer but are still close by while I’m working.I’m a soccer (or football, if you like) fan and collect scarves from places I visit. No, I’m not a supporter of all these clubs, but they make for great conversation starters in research sessions! I also like maps and have two giant ones hanging in my office, including this one of the United States where I traced the routes I took when I drove cross country and back:My office doesn’t double as a lounge area, kids playroom, or spare bedroom. I don’t have things like a couch, a TV, or video games in here. This helps me set boundaries while working from home: when I’m in my office, I’m usually working.Rambunctious kids, house guests, cabin fever… sometimes I just need to get out of the house. I work outside my house once or twice a month. My go-to places are the local coffee shop and the library. The former offers great coffee and chatter and the latter offers lots of space and quiet. Both offer reliable WiFi. I’m deliberate with the kind of work I do since I don’t bring my large screens with me (can you imagine if I did 😂).So that’s where I work from as a remote worker at Stack Overflow. I spend ~50 hours a week in my home office, so I put a lot of thought into its design. The room is big enough, I have a window, and I have everything I need without too many distractions.🏠✌----I plan, prototype, & publish for the web & email ¶ Design @dialpad ¶ +1 climate tech, hockey, snowboarding, soccer, Troy McClure quotes ¶ #blacklivesmatterTed GoasinUX Collective--10Ted GoasinUX Collective--2Ted GoasinEmail Design--1Ted GoasinUX Collective--8Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ted Goas,https://medium.com/,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*cdYjBuabiWXtG-jCl0DhdQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*17CEzZ_VS0HKWfhF4HXD5g.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*eHphiNOyLQFno0MY18NUqA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vjcMJdk1dJiu-HUzzjET3w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mpBvJhzKcxQK7NgepOnhKw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*pwrhajz1UBf70AQRp8JfXg.jpeg",4,857

Because of their ability to create advanced artificial intelligence, quantum computers can be used to simulate the required chemical reactions for new material or drug development. Building quantum computers is a very difficult process because their components, quantum bits or “qubits”, have to be kept in highly controlled environments.A team of researchers from the UK and France have demonstrated that it may be possible to build a quantum computer by using standard silicon-based electronic components. If possible, large-scale manufacturing of quantum computers can occur much sooner than predicted.Unlike traditional computers (which store information in binary bits that are either “0” or “1”), quantum computers use qubits which can store information as a combination of “0” and “1” — at the same time! This is possible because of the law of superposition.Currently, quantum computer development is still in its early stages. Several hardware technologies are available, however, none are dominating the “young” field, yet. The most advanced prototypes of quantum computers have been made by either trapping ions in a vacuum chamber or superconducting circuits, which are kept at a near absolute zero temperature. The biggest challenge with assembling the computers is scaling up the small models into larger, interconnected qubit systems and the technology which might allow for this to happen is the silicon transistor — the basic device used in all microprocessors and memory chips.Due to Moore’s Law, silicon devices have been miniaturised over the years to become only a few tens of atoms wide, which is the scale that triggers the laws of quantum physics. However, there is a physical limit that is halting any further miniaturisation of silicon transistors. Nevertheless, new uses of silicon technology are providing the possibility of encoding a quantum bit of information into each silicon transistor and then using them to build quantum computers. By reusing the same technology used by the microchip industry for the past 60 years, costs for producing the silicon quantum bits can be reduced. Furthermore, current engineering and processing methods used in the development of modern microelectronics can be adapted to build powerful quantum processors.The experiments conducted by research teams at Cambridge University, Hitachi R&D, University College London and CEA-LETI, in collaboration with The Conversation, were recently published in Nature Electronics.The teams applied engineering solutions from conventional circuits to attach different quantum devices on a silicon chip. Additionally, they developed a circuit which operates at near absolute zero temperature and uses commercial transistors (some small enough to act as qubits). Their results suggest that the integration of conventional and quantum electronics can be the (currently) best available process to advance quantum computer production.The future of quantum technology could be made of silicon!----hope your dreams come true :)angel--angel--angel--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Ethan SiegelinStarts With A Bang!--7Salvatore RaieliinTowards Data Science--9HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",angel,https://medium.com/@angel4time,1,3,55

In today’s post we will continue our journey into the fascinating realms of how consensus is found in different blockchain systems!After having taken an in-depth look into Proof of Work in the last post, this piece will focus on another highly popular consensus mechanism — Proof of Stake. We will look at it’s history, analyze how it works and what makes it stand apart from other forms of finding consensus, but also look at its potential limitations.Ready? Then let’s get going.This article is part eight of our journey into the technological foundations of blockchain technology.If you’re new here and want to understand what’s going on, just click here.If you’re interested in exploring the fascinating history behind blockchain, click right here and go down the rabbit hole.The importance of finding consensus and the extraordinary difficulty of it, especially in decentralized systems, has been explained in length in the prior two post on Finding Consensus, therefore we won’t dive too deep into this baseline here. If you want to recap the essentials of this interesting topic, I’d recommend you to give them a quick read:Part one focused on Byzantine Fault Tolerancemedium.comAnd part two on Proof of Workmedium.comWith the growing popularity of Bitcoin in the years after it has seen the day of light in 2009, more and more people started to get interested in the underlying technology, known as blockchain.Many other blockchain projects were started in those years, which in the beginning all continued to make use of Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW).While PoW is very effective at securing the public ledger and creating a strong set of incentives to act in an honest and integer way, it tends also to be very energy consuming. That particular aspect is due to the nature of the way consensus is found — participating nodes (aka computers) try to guess the right solution to a complicated cryptographic puzzle. By utilizing a lot of computational power, they require a lot of energy, which turns into tangible costs for the users who own the computers.Along comes the prolific developer Sunny King, who in 2012 proposed a completely new way of finding consensus, which he dubbed Proof of Stake.His idea revolved around finding a way to achieve consensus by internalizing the whole process — instead of using external hardware, which consumes a lot of energy to run, he came up with a purely software-based mechanism to validate blocks and therefore finding consensus.He first implemented this idea in his cryptocurrency project Peercoin.Before we take a look at how this mechanism works, it’s essential to understand that public blockchains inherently need to have a cryptocurrency (aka token), since its fundamental properties of security and honesty are due to the financial incentives enabled through rewarding honest behavior by giving out these tokens.For example, Bitcoin achieves to maintain the integrity of their public ledger due to all the miners who take part in the mining race, at which end there lays a reward of not only the transaction fees, but also an amount of newly generated Bitcoin.With that understood, we will now examine of Proof of Stake functions:First of all, the participating computers in a Proof of Stake network are normally not called miners but rather forgers or minters. Every node that wants to take part in the process of forming a new block of transactions and gain the right to propagate it to the whole system, need to show its commitment to wanting to perform this duty. In order to demonstrate this willingness, participants need to stake an amount of the coin that is being used on that particular blockchain.This is done by creating a special transaction, which locks the amount of cryptocurrency in a special deposit — the amount is now considered staked.Using a lottery style mechanism, the system then randomly chooses a participating user (who has a stake) as a validator for a block of transactions, and thus gives him a financial reward in the form of transaction fees and newly minted coins (not always though, this differs from project to project).The more coins a user has staked, the higher is the chance of being selected.Now you might think that sounds like a situation ripe for abuse of some wealthy big wales, who hold a huge chunk of the respective coins?Well, in order to ensure a certain level of fairness, there are a couple of ideas that have been developed — their implementation again depends on the specific blockchain in question of course.One of most widely used concepts is Coin Age Selection.The idea behind this is simple, you multiply the amount of coins in the deposit with the number of days they have been staked — the higher the resulting cumulative Coin Age, the higher the chance of being selected. There are a couple of rules that normally tend to apply for this concept:In order to be considered for the selection process, the coins need to be staked at least for a duration of 30 days. The maximum age that a coin can accumulate is reached after 90 days. Also, if a user has been chosen as a block validator, a new transaction is created that sends the staked coins back into the user’s wallet — this automatically resets the timer a user has to wait before being eligible for the selection process once more.How does this system ensure an honest behavior you might ask yourself now?It turns out that in the case of an invalid block being propagated to the rest of the system, the respective user would lose his deposit. This creates a strong incentive to act with integrity, since everything else would result in ensured financial loss.The main advantages of Proof of Stake are mainly the following three:A high energy efficiency, especially compared to PoW, which is due to the purely software based nature of it.Also, the possibility of people grouping their resources together and thus creating large mining pools doesn’t lead to an exponentially growing influence, as would be the case in PoW — therefore potentially strengthening the decentralized nature of the system.Last but not least, security plays a big role. A majority attack, in which a malicious actor controls the majority of the network, would require the attacker to be in possession if at least 51% of the total supply. If somebody would actually want to stage such an attack, the more tokens would be bought would lead to an increasing token price, making it extremely expensive. Should the attack then go through, the coin value would most certainly drop immensely — leading to a huge financial loss of the attacker.On an interesting side note, there are two things that I’d love to share with you.The first one revolves around the creator of this consensus mechanism, Sunny King, who created another very interesting blockchain in 2013, which goes by the name of Primecoin. This system used Proof of Work as the underlying consensus mechanism, but combined the mining with something really useful — searching for Prime numbers, which then in turn can be used by scientist free of charge.From a historic perspective it might also be very interesting for you to dive into the story of Wei Dai’s b-money idea from 1998. In it, Dai proposed a similar concept of using staked deposits as a mean of dis-incentivizing bad behavior.medium.comNext up, we’ll take a look at some alternative consensus mechanisms that have been created based upon Proof of Stake.One of the best known alternatives is the so-called Delegated Proof of Stake model.It works by combing real time voting with a social system of reputation. All the users of the system can vote for delegates (sometimes also called witnesses), with the voting power increasing proportionally to the amount of tokens (aka coins) hold.The elected delegates now have the responsibility to ensure that the nodes are up and running, that all the transactions across the network are collected into blocks, are subsequently validated and in the case of dispute, resolve the issues.If a delegate would act in a dishonest way, he can easily be voted out of the network and the delegate would lose his stake. The smaller amount of elected delegates leads to a more efficient and more effective consensus mechanism, with a high transaction throughput.Another idea is called Leased Proof of Stake. This concepts revolves around the idea, that users are able to lease their coins to a node that they trust — without giving up ownership of the coins though. Any financial reward that that node that gets, by successfully validating blocks, is shared with the respective users who leased their stake.There are two big potential limitations to the overall security of a Proof of Stake blockchain, both of these were coined for the first time by Andrew Poelstra in his paper “On Stake and Consensus” — a worthwhile, even though quite technical read.The first one is the so-called nothing at stake problem.After consensus has been found in a Proof of Work blockchain, the validated block is then added to the chain. Due to the inherent latency of the underlying communication channel (the Internet), it can happen that two valid blocks are mined at the same time. The network achieves to agree on the valid chain by always selecting the longest chain, since the most work went into producing it. If somebody wants to change the transaction history in the past in a PoW system, that actor would need to redo all the work that went into producing the prior blocks — which would amount to an enormous amount of energy, ergo cost being required.If we break all of this down to its core, it’s actually not a technical thing, but rather social norms that lay behind this. The choice of which software to use is up to every participant, so technically everybody’s free to implement whatever consensus rule they fancy — yet, if the rest of the network chooses not to use that same software, that would be a senseless endeavor.When it comes to Proof of Stake blockchains, there is no special hardware required in order to secure the system. Due to this, users can theoretically vote on many different versions of a blockchain in order to increase their chance of a financial reward — this would lead to consensus becoming incredibly difficult to be found. Since users have nothing at stake, it’d be in their best interest and logical rational to engage in this behavior.A possible solution to this is to penalize nodes who vote on two different versions of one block or to penalize those voting on a wrong block.The second issue is known as long range problem.This issue revolves around the problem that people who participated in the early days of a Proof of State blockchain could theoretically revert all of the blockchain history. How exactly would that play out?Well, these early users could go back in the blockchain’s history and start from a point where they exerted a big influence. Since there is no need to provide enormous amounts of computational power in a Proof of Stake blockchain, chains can be grown very long very fast.Now a problem known as weak subjectivity enters the stage.Let’s say you chose to become a new participant in a Proof of Stake blockchain. Once you’ve set up your computer, the installed software now needs to know which chain that circulates in the system can be trusted (aka the so-called main chain). Your computer know finds itself in the situation that it needs to ask another computer for that information — and trust it that the information is correct. This leads to a big problem of trust arising, because you could fall prey to one of those doctored chains mentioned above.Since trust is at the core of blockchain technology and is considered as the most essential invention, the need to trust a third party leads to a fundamental problem. There are workarounds to this problem, such as having trusted servers that frequently send out a hash of the correct main chain, yet this degree of centralization lingers along.I’d love to end this post with a quote by my fellow Medium writer Abhishek Sharma:“There appears to be a clear trade-off between mining costs and the level of trust required of other participants in the blockchain.It may be the case that if we want to curb the immense resource consumption of cryptocurrencies, we will have to once again trust each other instead of mathematical proofs.”If you’ve reached this point you can pad yourself on your back — you’ve made it through the whole post.

Happy Thursday and happy Easter long weekend!Did you know that Canada is a food insecure country?Neither did I. We import the majority of the food we eat. We supply ourselves largely from two states in the U.S. and a handful of regions in Mexico. If anything were to happen in those areas, we’d have two weeks of supply. In remote parts of Canada, it’s a lot less. Now, how do we solve this?This is not a unique Canadian challenge, but one that is becoming a serious global threat. In fact, food crises made it into the Top 10 of the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Risks Report. It might not feel like Canada has a limited food supply, but these threats are likely to become exponentially more difficult to address if we don’t begin to make significant strides in the next three to five years.Misinformation, mental health, and digital addiction are also examples of emerging threats that will impact every sector, family, workplace, and community over the next decade. How are Canadian social entrepreneurs helping to address this?As part of our new series on tackling emerging threats through entrepreneurship, we spoke with Corey Ellis, co-founder and CEO of Growcer, a high-potential AgTech company, on what he’s learned about food insecurity, how he structured his organization for quick traction, and what social entrepreneurs need to succeed.We formally announced this week that Future of Good will be a social impact content partner at Singularity U Canada’s 2019 Summit taking place April 23–24 in Edmonton, with satellite events across the country.

A Vision for a Circular Economy in Canada: The Benefits of Plastics Without the Waste and How We Get it RightWhy It Matters: The current economy has given us a plastics problem globally. The use of plastics today is a highly wasteful, linear, take-make-waste model that is harmful to the environment and misses economic opportunities. According to a new report by Smart Prosperity Institute, a plastics circular economy would recirculate materials in an environmentally and financially sustainable closed loop. It reduces waste and emissions while capturing value. Go deeper2. Can’t Make It in Person?

151,53625,https://medium.com/@mbeh/africa-participation-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-da1b2aa35415?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,Africa Participation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,None,"Gilbert MbehFollow--ListenShare-From a founder’s perspective-The world now sits on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, marking the fusion of multiple technologies such as AI, robotics, nanotechnology, genetics, biotech and 3D printing. Rapid population growth compels governments to respond to citizens who clamor for change. Listening to the rhythm of the many communities by harnessing AI will inform timely decisions.The old rules by which nations played the political and economic games are vanishing. All the tools required to become a highly industrialized country have already been invented. Access to skills in developing these tools is becoming cheaper by the day as mobile devices transform access to education.Throughout the ages, few risks have been more consequential than arriving late to the digital realm. Technology is rendering skills that were once highly valued obsolete. In this climate, everything changes. Past industrial revolutions bypassed Africa. Today, we are equipped to disrupt the status quo on a burgeoning continent.Promising startups are already creating employment and significantly impacting their communities. The current entrepreneurial trend ushers in ground breaking products and services. It demolishes institutional roadblocks to services at every level; solutions are surfacing for almost every problem. The result? A fast growing service sector which in 20 years or less will shrink widespread dependence on subsistence agriculture.With the known hurdles in accessing funding, entrepreneurs in Africa are already addressing some of the biggest impediments to socioeconomic development. Thanks to the rapid proliferation of mobile communications, people can instantly access vital services anytime, anywhere.Contrast this scenario with the first industrial revolution that began in the late 18th century, long before most African countries embraced new manufacturing processes. That celebrated transition from hand production methods to machines improved efficiency, largely with the aid of water power.The Second Industrial Revolution started in the 19th century in Europe and North America. It launched a steel industry and giant corporations that would engage in mass production. Cottage industries fell victim to well-capitalized companies that invested in research and development. Armed with new inventions, they grew even larger.Innovations produced great social impact that spurred even more progress. Resulting wealth helped lift the living conditions of an increasingly large percentage of the population as the 20th century began.African communities experienced severe diplomatic pressures, military invasions, and eventual conquest and colonization. As World War I ended, United States President Woodrow Wilson declared support for self determination and an end to colonial rule. But it took three more decades before the United Nations General Assembly — formed in the aftermath of World War II — empowered independence movements. On December 12, 1948 the United Nations recognized the republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea.Within two decades, an independent South Korea began establishing a protectionist economic policy. A policy of industrialization by import substitution was applied. It curtailed entry into the country of all kinds of foreign products, except raw materials. In less than three decades, concentrated state support featuring tax breaks, cheap or free financing spawned diversified multinational conglomerates such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG Corporate. Their steep rise vaulted South Korea to global industrial leadership.When the third industrial revolution became visible after 1969, powered by breakthroughs in electronics and information technology, much of the developed world saw unprecedented innovation across every commercial sector. A majority of African countries with just a few years of independence were struggling with new forms of governance. Cameroon, which won independence in 1960, was sailing into a blurry but promising future.In Europe and North America, the Industrial Revolutions had already changed the way people worked and acquired goods, the number of goods in circulation, and economic relationship between industrialized and non-industrialized regions of the world. From the 18th century through the 19th century right up to the 21th century, Africa had been a reliable supplier of both raw materials and human capital to the industrialized world even in times of war as in times of peace.While entrepreneurs would have a pivotal role to play in the transformation of Africa, no African government can afford to stay neutral. They must include technology in their priority spending through support to the private sector, improved government infrastructures, subsidies for tech startups and an enabling environment for local and foreign investments.Three industrial revolutions have reshaped the world. The next one favors Africa. Unlike more advanced economies, we are not mired in legacy systems and practices. By leveraging new technologies that automate tasks and skills, Africa can lead a global digital revolution.The claim that America took more than two centuries to become what it is today is not relevant. Historical underdevelopment now poses an advantage. Africa can assert tech leadership in 20 years or less. Disputing this claim ignores the astronomical potential of the AI revolution, 3D printing, robotics, the blockchain technology and the ongoing development of new technologies already driving changes and transforming lives across the continent. A nimble, technologically backed service sector will spur structural transformation in the occupational structure of every national economy.Africa by 2040 will attain a significant level of self sustained industrialization and transformations in the agricultural and services sectors capable of catering to a significantly growing population. Access to healthcare will be as easy as clicking our messaging app. Competitiveness will improve affordability and quality, as people will prioritize access over ownership.Achieving a self sustained level of industrialization by 2040 is not longer a question of how possible, but rather how willing; with the few addressable challenges being; access to large investment capital whose limitation exposes entrepreneurs and startups to a number of market risks, policies differences in Africa also slows down startups from scaling to new territories.Africa informed participation in the Fourth industrial revolution will help a greater part of the continent achieve a sustained economic growth and security that will bring high level of occupancy/employment which will lead to low birth rate and higher life expectancy. EdTech — shorthand for education technology — will make education less expensive and more accessible. The ability to export high value added goods and services will skyrocket. And as always, investors who are already identifying the endless opportunities in Africa will reap vast benefits on a new safe investment haven as Africa asserts leadership on the global map.----Gilbert Mbeh is a technology entrepreneur, he is the founder and chief executive officer of AbegYa, an African information-rich digital marketplace.Gilbert Mbeh--Gilbert Mbeh--Gilbert Mbeh--Gilbert Mbeh--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Gilbert Mbeh,https://medium.com/@mbeh,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*w17C-ruTF3Iv-GVtjN--kQ.jpeg",5,0

That’s because it is streamlined and has a user-friendly interface, and because it is designed specifically to run on the super-affordable Raspberry Pi line of single-board computers. We see a lot of home console-style RetroPie builds here on Hackster.io, but they’re usually based on the full-size Raspberry Pi models. FacelessTech, however, built a portable handheld RetroPie console around the low-power Raspberry Pi Zero W.Because the RetroZero uses the Raspberry Pi Zero W, which is significantly less powerful than full-size models like the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, it isn’t capable of running console emulators past the 16bit generation very well. But anything from that era or earlier should run pretty smoothly. The most impressive thing about this particular build is how compact it is. It’s roughly the size of the original Nintendo Game Boy, but packs in everything needed for RetroPie gaming on the go.Aside from the Raspberry Pi Zero W, the RetroZero also contains a 2.4"" TFT display, a power bank board and 2000mAh LiPo battery, 12 soft-touch buttons, and speakers. To save space, the TFT display is just a bare screen without a breakout board and the buttons are SMT (surface-mount technology). The design of the RetroZero is split between two custom PCBs, with the Raspberry Pi and LiPo circuit sandwiched between them. Standoffs are used to mount the two PCBs together. FacelessTech hasn’t designed an enclosure for the RetroZero yet, but that should be a pretty straightforward process.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--1Cameron Coward--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Cameron Coward,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*crkf3qrHOAIex-hrlr1-wg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8_YOyZPmY2Lhloa6m_aPpQ.png",2,59
154,10893,https://medium.com/sharedstreets/why-were-building-sharedstreets-22352c1ff23b?source=tag_archive---------71-----------------------,Why We’re Building SharedStreets,None,"Mollie Pelon McArdleFollowSharedStreets--ListenShareTools for the ‘bottom-up’ digital city — Mollie Pelon McArdle and Kevin WebbIt is no secret that the way we move around cities has dramatically changed in the last decade. It is also no secret that the majority of new mobility modes that have dropped on our doorsteps have not met infrastructure that is ready for their arrival — physical or digital. Just as our built infrastructure is still making space for bike share systems, scooters, and new models for goods delivery, our digital infrastructure has some serious catching up to do.We have met a moment where an important choice confronts us. Create digital infrastructure that is open and enables inclusive, bottom-up participation in shaping cities through protocols for communication and collaboration, or follow suit with the last decade of innovation by creating a top-down “platform-powered” notion of technology, that doubles-down on control and centralization.A person’s ability to travel freely or gather for political purposes, without hindrance or surveillance, on public streets is a true measure of how democracy works in our cities. SharedStreets is built on the belief that the map of the street is critical public infrastructure. We know that a shared digital language for the street can revolutionize the way we build cities and move around them. It is the foundation for the future we want to live in and we think that it is essential this digital infrastructure be open to all, just like the streets and cities it supports.These are the values we encode in the open source software and open data infrastructures we build for and with cities and companies to seamlessly share information about the street. At the core of that work is the shared belief that the city is a common good and that the citizens hold the power to collectively shape their cities (David Harvey, The Right to the City). That gets trickier in the age of technology, but we know that great cities aren’t created by the architecture of control. They’re designed by people, through the architecture of participation.We created SharedStreets to enable and empower cities to make decisions based on the best information about their streets. Our work is designed to be a launching pad for experimentation and new bottom-up models of innovation and governance.SharedStreets is both a language of communication and a growing set of modular tools that allow everyone to speak with clarity and precision about how our transport system works. These tools can be used together or integrated into your workflow separately and as needed. Since everything we build is open-source, anyone can build their own systems on top of our work, adapt it, extend it, or make it their own.How do you make a complex digital system transparent, open, and adaptable so that it can change with the city and its people?Make the digital map of the street shared understanding, not proprietary insight.SharedStreets uses a shared digital understanding of streets to unlock far more value and potential than any one entity can gain from controlling it. Democratic ownership of identifiers is what makes things like the internet possible — and like the purely digital internet identifiers, SharedStreets is building an addressing system for digital representations of physical space, which in turn support new protocols for communication about city streets.Up until now we’ve relied on raw spatial coordinates like latitude and longitude, or building numbers to define where things are, but those aren’t able to describe many new forms of data critical to managing our transportation system, like the location of a parking space or a bus stop, in a way that a computer could read.It is not a new idea that identifiers are a form of power. The ability and right to name things has applied to everything from postal addresses to people. But precise, structured identifiers about streets and public space are becoming increasingly important as new forms of digital regulation and coordination depend on structured machine-readable definitions of space.Just as our physical worlds are shaped by our own understanding, our digital understanding of the world is formed by consensus. To paraphrase famed 20th century statistician (aka “Data Scientist”) , George Box, all maps are wrong, but some are useful. All representations of the world, digital or otherwise, are imperfect, incomplete, and ever evolving . Rather pursuing a single universal digital truth, SharedStreets is creating tools and protocols that allow us to share insight and data linked to multitude of maps of different quality and perspective.In our work at SharedStreets, we’re helping cities build trust instead of tracking systems, manage change without control, and democratize the creation (and re-creation) of our digital cities. Working from the bottom-up is both messier and more nuanced than top-down control. But that messiness is what makes it resilient, adaptable, and extraordinarily innovative. And the healthiest, most innovative and resilient cities are complex, messy places, too, for precisely the same reason.This post was shaped by our team members, Tim O’Reilly’s ‘The Architecture of Participation, Andrew Eland & Richard Pope’s ‘A Right to the Digital City’, David Harvey’s ‘The Right to the City’, and Martin Tisne’s ‘It’s Time for a Data Bill of Rights’.----SharedStreetsco-director, SharedStreets & The Open Transport PartnershipMollie Pelon McArdleinSharedStreets--Morgan HerlockerinSharedStreets--Emily ErosinSharedStreets--Mollie Pelon McArdleinSharedStreets--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Daniel RizeainEntrepreneur's Handbook--6Alex Mathers--227Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Mollie Pelon McArdle,https://medium.com/@molliemcardle,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wyuN0Ufh4n_6N3B-WJD2ng.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*uEBRPpIsHViXdLirmidy1Q.png",4,78

Despite this, many individuals have a hard time keeping track of their disease as life gets in the way, but technology can help.Automatic insulin machines can be placed in a patient and work identically to a normal pancreas. They continuously measure blood concentrations of insulin, glucagon, and glucose, and they release insulin as needed. Called the Control-IQ System, this machine uses the body’s status to craft an algorithm that matches a patient’s natural state. This allows for very accurate insulin dosing.This machine works quite well based on current research. Individuals using them did not have low blood glucose levels overnight, which is a potential threat for those with diabetes. In fact, people using the Control-IQ System were within the accepted range of blood glucose levels for nearly three hours longer than those not using the artificial pancreas. Of note, one participant experienced diabetic ketoacidosis, but this was due to a problem with the machine not seen with others.Millions of people, both children, and adults, have some form of diabetes, and the most vulnerable to its negative effects are the youngest and oldest people suffering from the ailment. Most people still need to monitor their blood frequently to administer insulin or other medications to help them control their diabetes, yet this is simply not manageable for some members of the population. The artificial pancreas can reduce this burden, both on caregivers and those with diabetes.When one has a machine like the Control-IQ System, that person no longer needs to worry much about their blood glucose concentration. This is perfect for young children and elderly persons who may have a hard time remembering to do this. This also helps the caregivers of these vulnerable people because they can spend more time caring for themselves and the other needs that children and elderly people sometimes have.Although diabetes management can be complex, researchers are constantly hunting for a cure and for ways to make the management of this disease easier. The Control-IQ System, though not a cure, does help manage the disease by silently tracking glucose levels and administering insulin as needed.----Chika Wonah is a seasoned Information Security Professional.

158,7538,https://medium.com/@systango/unlock-django-framework-with-kerberos-92106035848b?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,Unlock Django Framework With Kerberos,None,"SYSTANGOFollow--1ListenShareProblem statement:When we develop applications in Django rest framework we make use of auth-mechanisms, presumably based on django.contrib.auth. Now when an enterprise having an existing identity management solution plans to deploy the application they often mandate that for a seamless user experience, we have a solution that can allow the enterprises to retain their auth mechanism and add on apps leveraging from it. These enterprises use auth mechanisms like Kerberos, LDAP, GSSAPI etc.Kerberos is used for authenticating users who wish to access services on various servers in an enterprise network. Typically, this is used within corporate/internal environments. Perhaps you want to access your internal payroll site. Rather than re-entering your user/password credentials, your ticket (cached on your system) is used to authenticate allowing for single sign-on.Basically, Kerberos comes down to just this:Kerberos terminology:Client : An entity on the network (a user, a host, or an application) that can receive a ticket from Kerberos.Ticket : A temporary set of credentials that verify the identity of a client for a particular service.Realm : A network that uses Kerberos, composed of one or more servers and a potentially large number of clients.Principal : The principal name or principal is the unique name of a user or service allowed to authenticate using Kerberos.Kinit : The kinit command allows a principal who has already logged in to obtain and cache the initial ticketTicket Granting Service (TGS) : A server that issues tickets for a desired service which are in turn given to users for access to the service. The TGS usually runs on the same host as the KDCKey Distribution Center (KDC) : A service that issues Kerberos tickets, usually run on the same host as the Ticket Granting ServerTicket Granting Ticket (TGT) : A special ticket that allows the client to obtain additional tickets without applying for them from the KDC.Deploying our application on such systems that have an auth-mechanism pre-configured, implies that our application’s auth mechanism must talk to that of the system’s.Proposed solutions:A well suited library for Kerberos authentication in Django is “django-auth-kerberos”. It is timely maintained and easy to use and install. It can be installed by following the below steps:1) pip install django-auth-kerberos2) following settings are configured in settings.py:a) Add django_auth_kerberos to the installed apps.INSTALLED_APPS = (‘Django_auth_kerberos’,)b) Set the following parameters:# kerberos realm and serviceKRB5_REALM = ‘EXAMPLE.COM’KRB5_SERVICE = ‘[hostname]/EXAMPLE.COM’# Enabled KDC verification defending against rogue KDC responses# by validating the ticket against the local keytab.KRB5_VERIFY_KDC = True# Enable case-sensitive matching between Kerberos and database user namesKRB5_USERNAME_MATCH_IEXACT = True# redirect url after loginLOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = ‘/’# enable kerberos auth backendsAUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (‘django_auth_kerberos.backends.KrbBackend’,)3) KrbBackend is the class responsible for authenticating the user. Here is a snippet of how it can be used:There are some common errors that one may encounter when authenticating a kerberos user such as the following :1) “No such file or directory”Resolution : Configure an empty service principle. So KRB5_SERVICE should be ‘’.2) “Permission denied”Resolution : Set the value of KRB5_VERIFY_KDC to False.There are other authentication mechanisms like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) . Usually,Kerberos is used for user authentication and LDAP for user authorization. Even though LDAP can also be used for authentication, Kerberos is prefered since it is more secure.Both of these mechanisms talk to a directory services database called an Active directory. Active Directory (AD) is a Windows OS directory service that facilitates working with interconnected, complex and different network resources in a unified manner. So in short Kerberos and LDAP are application protocols used to query and modify items in directory services like Active directory.Why use django and kerberos ?Python and Django provide a number of libraries to authenticate against Kerberos. For instance django-auth-kerberos, django-kerberos, python-kerberos, pykerberos. Using Django allauth on the top of kerberos can server as a double layer of security for the users. Kerberos in itself is a very strong security mechanism.

It resulted in an increased emphasis on outcome-based Education or learning (OBE). It is a learner-driven system, wherein it helps the learner with their objectives and also facilitates the faculty accordingly. Further, the most important aims in higher education are the attainment of critical thinking and gaining higher order thinking skills. In the college education ecosystem, the faculty’s role has become important in identifying ways to encourage students, applying various methods in teaching and to efficiently assess the student’s learner outcomes and the skills levels. Outcomes specify what student will know or be able to do as a result of the learning activity. Bloom’s taxonomy has given reasonable guidelines in designing the model to assess the outcomes of various cognitive levels of the students.Edwisely provides a learning experience to students with tremendous flexibility, allowing them to learn in their own way, at their own pace, and most convenient way for them. This platform can be immensely beneficial to students. The platform provides guidance through a recommendation engine powered by artificial intelligence so that students can reach their goals. Edwisely automatically provides students with the kinds of learning supports that a tutor would provide at the times the students need feedback, while still allowing students to retain the freedom and control the system already provides. We are researching to enhance and evolve the platform and will be releasing an advanced system in the next phase.At Edwisely we enable learners to embrace the true power of self-learning. Self Learning is an established concept in learning research, and it relates to the capacity of the student to support their own learning by deploying various techniques to increase understanding and retain information. Factors involved in self-learning include cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and emotional aspects of learning. All of us engage in self-learning to some extent, so we’re all familiar to varying degrees with many of these techniques, such as goal-setting, time management, revision, self-testing, note-taking, help-seeking, along with many other behaviors that improve the student’s learning.Edwisely’s learning platform offers tools that enable self-learning behaviors, but without encouragement, we may see students engaging in these behaviors only to the extent that they would naturally — thus maintaining the achievement gap between strong self-learners and others. We want to help all kinds of learners and decided to have two approaches to encourage self-learning activity. Edwisely is focused on raising the standard of all students, and it enables detailed observation of student learning, measurement of that learning, and intervention wherever needed by the teacher or by the system.Edwisely is looking for research collaborations with like-minded educational institutions to build a futuristic learning ecosystem.Reach us: innovation@edwisely.comwww.edwisely.com----Founder of Edwisely, a life long learner.

164,2363,https://medium.com/crleveille/building-an-award-winning-innovation-lab-in-9-months-d404981db225?source=tag_archive---------67-----------------------,BUILDING AN AWARD-WINNING INNOVATION LAB IN 9 MONTHS,None,"Ryan LeveilleFollowCRLeveille--ListenShareShortly before the formation of General Electric (GE), Thomas Edison began experimenting with electrified rail as a proof-of-concept. Just a few years later, the newly established company piloted an electric train line for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. With a three-mile track and 10-cent fare, the accident-free operation was a glimpse into the future of North American passenger rail. GE would go on to win the bid against Westinghouse for New York’s Grand Central Terminal, because of its locomotive. Since then, GE Transportation has continued to be a key partner in U.S. domestic manufacturing, shipping, and industrialization, with an ever-expanding global footprint.Our founder Thomas Edison was a tinkerer, a thinker, a doer, and an innovator — he was inspired. According to the Edison Innovation Foundation, he operated on four simple principles, instilled by his mother:1. Never get discouraged if you fail. Learn from it. Keep trying.2. Learn with both your head and hands.3. Not everything of value in life comes from books — experience the world.4. Never stop learning. Read the entire panorama of literature.GE and the later GE Transportation were founded on these principles of fortitude, experimentation, and entrepreneurial spirit — all of which carry into our brand messaging today. Edison recognized the value of design and research-led organizations as a means of discovering new value for people and opportunities for business.His entrepreneurial spirit is what attracted me to GE companies in 2013. When I transitioned from my role at GE Energy and accepted a position at GE Transportation in 2016, it was quickly apparent my new home was struggling to reimagine its legacy software solutions within an industry ripe for disruption. During my time at GE Energy, I’d spent three years embedded in the Bay-area startup scene, partnering with and learning from best-in-class design innovation firms including Frog, Adaptive Path, and IDEO to re-imagine everything from delightful customer service frameworks to proof-of-concepts, pilots, and products for our Fortune 10 customers BP and Chevron. In contrast with this experience, there was an immediate realization GE Transportation was lacking the type of formal innovation framework seen in forward-thinking companies and prevalent in the venture-backed startups I’d been exposed to — those who would jump at any chance to take a piece of veteran-provider GE’s market. Somewhere along the way, GE Transportation had lost some important parts of founder Thomas Edison’s original vision, spirit, and appetite for innovation risk — and it felt as though my invitation into the company was an unspoken mission to remind our teams of our roots.With that same entrepreneurial spirit and while maintaining my responsibilities as a UX design lead, I leveraged my passion, spare time and expertise in design thinking to build a case to create an innovation ecosystem at GE Transportation. After several months of iteration on the design led approach with key stakeholders, executive leadership promoted me to Global Design Manager to lead what would become an award-winning innovation lab in nine months.*The case study will take you on a design-led journey of creating an innovation lab along with a few lessons learned from the experience.The problem to be solved?The existing approach to innovation was reactive in nature and myopic overall. The company relied on project-centric customer feedback for siloed functions and teams as a way to improve solutions incrementally day-to-day and rarely emphasized the need to strategize more holistically and look further into the future for leap opportunities.Several components of our culture and organizational structure were inhibiting our potential:Who are the users?The target audience and users of the Innovation Lab are all employees at GE Transportation along with the company’s external customers. In both environments, balancing the needs of existing users with the expectations of future users would be paramount.The employees at the company are talented and passionate about their work. They have both in-depth functional expertise and a deep understanding for their perspective customers’ problems. However, a majority of the employees have been working for GE Transportation most of their careers and have become accustomed to the status quo of legacy business processes steeped in history and nostalgia.The customers’ employees are also extremely talented and passionate about their work. Anyone who has met someone that works in the railroad business would probably attest to this as a fact. Similar to GE, the railroad industry as a whole is steeped in history and nostalgia and can sometimes be averse to fundamental changes in the status quo way of working.An interesting statistic around the workforce of the transportation industry was that in 2018, 50 percent of the veteran workforce was eligible to retire and the new replacement hires are recently graduated and highly educated. This creates both a challenge and an opportunity for a fundamental shift in the space due to shifting expectations of workplace solutions.What’s the goal of the initiative?Enable a 100-year-old industrial company to drive new and meaningful leap innovations.I aspired to systematically recapture the magic of our founder Thomas Edison’s approach to innovation. My ambition was to create an innovation framework that enabled the GE Transportation business to re-imagine a new future collectively, to embrace “failure/learning,” and to be inspired to try new things out in the world with customers and users. I believed that by harnessing the creativity of the workforce in a more unified approach with a common vision of the future would ultimately reveal leap innovation opportunities.My high-level goals were to:What’s my role in the project?As the Global Design Manager, I led the vision, strategy, execution, and branding to create the award-winning Innovation Lab at GE Transportation. I hired the cross functional team, configured the workspace layout, designed the digital platforms, created the engagement model, and formed the new product introduction process for the business.In addition to creating the lab, I led the cross functional innovation team in 30+ co-creation workshops with customers across our entire supply chain on five different continents to re-imagine the future of the industry together. The outputs consisted of research reports, vision roadmaps, proof-of-concepts, high-fidelity demos, and marketing videos to help make our future a reality.I also led business strategy workshops with our entire executive team to internalize our findings from customer co-creation workshops in order to commercialize our product roadmap strategy (back-casting).Balance the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the goals of the business and industry to take innovative leaps, avoid costly changes, ease adoption, align vision, and put immediate value into customers’ hands.User-centered DesignFocusing on the user gives my customers a better experience — making products and services more relevant and more compelling to use.Business StrategyLooking beyond single customer solutions to evaluate the industry as a whole, to create opportunities and drive change in a uniform direction.Emerging TechnologyKeeping a pulse on the latest and upcoming technology trends to envision future workspaces, the evolution of relationships between humans and devices, and to imagine what’s next.During discovery I strive to learn what people really need by immersing myself in the users’ environment and prioritize actionable opportunities. Together with a multi-disciplinary team, I then ideate concepts, evaluate assumptions, and leap past obvious solutions to arrive at an innovative vision of a potential solution. Once we have alignment, I involve stakeholders and users at every possible step to iteratively design and improve ideas. I then evaluate solutions, implement feedback, and continuously validate to craft a human story that resonates with both executive stakeholder and users to drive adoption.During the discovery phase of this initiative I began (as I almost always do) with secondary research to enhance my knowledge of the subject matter. I desired to learn from others’ successes and failures and focused on the foundational elements of innovation frameworks.I read 30+ papers in academic journals from renowned scholars such as Teresa M. Amabile and Vanessa Theis (to name only a couple). Through this effort I learned of significant innovation framework elements, for example, employee motivation and new product introduction processes at large organizations.Teresa M. Amabile provides insight into the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation when it comes to sustaining creativity throughout the lifecycle of a novel idea when she proposed the following:“Motivational Synergy: The prevailing psychological model of the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation suggests an antagonism: as extrinsic motivation for an activity increases, intrinsic motivation must decrease. But there is considerable evidence from field research that, under certain conditions, certain forms of extrinsic motivation may combine synergistically with intrinsic motivation, enhancing (or at least not undermining) the positive effects of intrinsic motivation on creativity.” For example, research in business organizations has uncovered several extrinsic motivators operating as supports to creativity: reward and recognition for creative ideas, clearly defined overall project goals, and frequent constructive feedback on the work”.Through her rigorous primary research of leading innovative companies, Vanessa Theis provides detailed instructions on new product introduction process best practices. The following is an excerpt from her research:“The idea comes from an individual, goes through concept development with the involvement of relevant specialists and is transformed into a robust concept while a multi-disciplinary team is assembled to develop it into a project. These teams enhance the initial idea by improving its market attractiveness, technical viability and strategic adequacy. The prioritized ideas are assessed by innovation committees, composed of the directors of the technology and innovation, commercial, industrial and business sectors, as well as the managers of the new products and markets, polymer science, pilot plants, laboratory, client accounts and innovation performance sectors. In summary, the goal of the committees is to classify projects according to specific organizational strategies, assess the development and results of ongoing projects and approve the continuation of projects into the next stage of the innovation funnel.”By reading books from authors Dan Pink, Simon Sinek, Eric Reis, and others, I learned that autonomy and the “why” are foundational elements that drive creativity in large organizations and the reason consumers are interested in your ideas.As Dan Pink highlighted:“Researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy, the other half relying on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover.”As Simon Sinek wrote:“When most organizations or people think, act or communicate they do so from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. And for good reason — they go from clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say WHY we do WHAT we do. When communicating from the inside out, however, the WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as the tangible proof of that belief.”In addition to the academic journals and renowned books, I reviewed magazine articles on innovation stories from Fast Co., Forbes, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, Inc. etc. It was in this Harvard Business Review article where I learned that the benefits from more productive co-working office spaces could be quantifiable.“Office space is not just an amortized asset. It’s a strategic tool for growth — 75% reported an increase in productivity since joining their co-working space.” — Harvard Business ReviewUltimately, the synthesis of learnings from secondary research provided visibility into the innovation frameworks that leading companies were leveraging as competitive advantages in their given industries. The key insight was companies that continuously showed up as innovation leaders are employing an innovation as an ecosystem approach with frameworks that evolve iteratively and become more robust over time.At a high level however, the five elements that consistently emerged as foundational to innovation frameworks were a strong vision, creative work place, dynamic and cross functional talent management, robust technologies, idea-to-product processes, and legal prowess.From this, I was able to conduct a competitive analysis of widely recognized innovative companies against GE Transportation to showcase an artifact to leadership which proved as a necessary catalyst for this initiative. The results visualized a substantial gap between the innovation elements leveraged at GE Transportation and the one’s deployed at leading innovative companies such as Google, 3M, Siemens, and IBM. Who doesn’t like a little competition to provide a sense of urgency in corporate executives?These new learnings, in addition to my previous experience in the space, provided direction into the different primary research work streams I would need to undertake to help bring this journey to life in the context of the GE Transportation business and industry.I interviewed and surveyed 100+ cross functional employees in every career band to understand if/why they felt compelled and/or enabled to innovate at the company.One of the most interesting insights out of this exercise was around GET’s hiring practices. It was stated that “we hire the same type of people, who are motivated by GE’s reputation for rapid career advancement through their people leadership program and not necessarily motivated by intrinsic passion to innovate”.I leveraged my professional relationships for site visits at Apple’s Enterprise Design Lab, Google Labs, SAP Innovation Hub, Booz Allen Hamilton Innovation Center, Teague, and Frog to learn first-hand of the different approaches to innovation frameworks at leading companies.I participated in an “Innovation Readiness Assessment” at SAP’s Innovation Hub to get a third party evaluation of how we measured against the best in class. Through SAP’s journey to become a design-led organization, they worked with 450 customers on co-innovation projects. Their experience led them to design an innovation readiness framework and assessment tool to show where a team or organization falls within their 4 stage model. SAP’s model is based on three measurable pillars to innovation: people, process, and place. GE Transportation’s innovation readiness score was 62%, which put us between stages 1 and 2 out of 4. This meant that the business still viewed design as a cost but had begun to consider it important.I visited GE’s Aviation and Healthcare Labs to leverage their experience within our industrial context. One great learning from GE Healthcare was how they trained and certified 1400 employees as “Design Thinking Champions” in order to generate critical mass in shifting mindsets for more creative, inclusive and progressive approaches to problem solving throughout the business.I interviewed leading innovators from other companies that were successfully driving innovation, such as Cisco Labs. I learned about a new software platform called BrightIdea that could be leveraged as the digital platform for our innovation portfolio management process. Since deploying their innovation program Cisco has increased revenue by $60MM from 86 new ideas and is projected to be at $170MM.Before the ideation phase of this initiative could begin I needed to synthesize, visualize and disseminate the learnings from secondary and primary research to generate buy-in across stakeholders in the business and to increase the desire to participate in this effort moving forward.I made the case that GE Transportation had a real opportunity to shift from “innovation by accretion” to “innovation by transformation” through a design-led approach.I accomplished this by quantifying the gap from GE Transportation to leading innovative companies, by elevating the true feedback and desire of our workforce across the business and by providing the ROI around the potential impact of investing in innovation as an ecosystem with a design-led approach.During the executive share out of insights from discovery, I proposed a series of design thinking workshops to ideate around potential solutions that best fit our business environment and to design a phased approach to iterate as we deployed, with our stakeholders and users at the center.During the ideation phase I facilitated workshops with both the executive team and front-line employees to re-imagine how to best accelerate innovation at the company.Core activities……Brought discovery research into the workshops as inputs;…Crafted methods to generate net new ideas that would enable an innovative culture;…Captured constraints and limitations of the business and how to navigate through them; and…Held prioritization exercises to hone in on the most important elements by phase.Concluding synthesis, the key insight from employees at GE Transportation was that this needed to be a holistic approach with a north star but phased iteratively as the business evolved. We needed to think big for the type of innovative company we wanted to strive to be, but we needed to start small and evolve over time with proof-points and re-evaluation along the way.The three high-level outputs that needed to be designed were an innovation ecosystem infographic to capture and communicate the foundational elements to ignite innovation, a phased roadmap for how to iteratively achieve the goals of this initiative and a new design-led innovation process to speed the success rate of new product introductions to the market.During the design phase I iteratively created and validated all the collateral that would be needed to begin communicating and executing against the vision.The deployment strategy was a phased approach to the innovation ecosystem to be communicated with a visual roadmap. On the horizontal were the core foundational elements that would ultimately make up the innovation ecosystem, the vision, the place, the people, the technology, the process and the legal capabilities. On the vertical were the different phases each of these elements would evolve towards with no specified time element. The power of this visual was how it highlighted the essential dependencies between each element of the innovation ecosystem, which unlocked the net new types of outcomes and experiences that could be created in each phase with this type of holistic approach. This was extremely important as it communicated to executive leadership that, generally, we could not necessarily invest in one element of the innovation ecosystem over another element because it would continue the myopic approach that already existed and would ultimately lead to continued ROI challenges. It would be paramount to identify which elements had the highest impact dependencies on the roadmap in order to align on the elements that needed initial funding and improve the likelihood of success for this initiative.Along with the various meta collateral and approach, I needed to evaluate the different workspace options for the innovation lab, the different types of roles for the dedicated cross functional team that needed to be hired, the different digital platforms for the new design-led innovation process to live on and ultimately the budget for this entire initiative.The selection criteria generated out of discovery and ideation workshops to identify the optimal workspace to drive innovation were a global footprint/membership with low initial capital investment, allowed us to get close to our customers for co-creation workshops, an open environment that was flexible enough to scale to different size engagements as needed and was considered an innovation hotbed of startups and other companies to collaborate and learn from together. The options were narrowed down to the Atlanta Tech Village, renovating our existing footprint and WeWork. The Atlanta Tech Village met two out of the three criteria, but it was missing the global element and had an eight-month onboard time. Renovating our own space did not meet any of our criteria, it would require a large up-front capital investment with a long lead time to create an open/collaborative space, it was not surrounded by a startup hotbed and wasn’t in an ideal location for our customers. It was ultimately decided that WeWork met all of our selection criteria needs.The cross functional team that needed to be hired was identified and prioritized based on the type of work that would enable the most valuable outcomes for the business during the initial phase. In addition, one of the core capabilities of every single innovation lab visited and studied was the ability to build out proof-of-concepts at a rapid pace. Finally, as a design-led initiative, it was recognized that we needed to begin with design capabilities to build out a backlog of both proof-of-concepts and vision roadmaps during our customer co-creation engagements. These two types of outputs would allow us to rapidly validate potential solutions with the market and also provide us with the optimal paths for go-to-market strategies. To drive the type of pace needed to accelerate our backlog of potential solutions there needed to be two teams of a User Experience Lead and a Researcher, a strong Visual Designer that could go across initiatives as needed and a Program Manager to lead the NPI platform/process. In addition to this initial team structure, I would act as the strategist across all our engagements along with all the duties as the leader of the innovation lab and innovation programs, etc.One of the most important elements identified to ignite innovation at GE Transportation was a New Product Introduction process that empowered 1500+ employees with decades of built up industry expertise to contribute their own ideas more cohesively. I structured the process around the design thinking phases where we could incrementally support initiatives as they built more and more viability with end-users and customers at the center. The new process would provide curated templates of the business model canvas and a newly created design thinking canvas that would act as the common language for the review sessions of each idea. Not only would this provide our governance leadership team with a more strategic lens for making funding decisions, it would also organically educate our employees to think/create with these criteria in mind.As a business, we needed to integrate innovation into the strategic-management agenda so ideas could be encouraged, managed, tracked, & measured. To accomplish this, we required a digital platform that the new product introduction process could live on. As part of the discovery process I identified the Bright Idea enterprise platform that was created to “harness the power of global collaboration, manage every initiative with the flexibility to grow and to drive innovation activities through to ROI”. The subscription model and configuration capabilities of this solution required little up-front investment as we launched the program, allowing us to prove it out along the way.As I initiated the Innovation Lab it became apparent that we needed collateral to communicate the Innovation Lab engagement model; the what, why, how and why we would be set up to create proof-of-concepts and vision roadmaps with our customers. Not only would this provide clarity and buy-in with the new approach, but it also acted as a catalyst for our branding strategy. We ultimately had two high-level design-led approaches, one was an accelerated engagement that produced conversational proof-of-concepts to validate with the market and the other was a deep dive engagement that led to code-ready proof-of-concepts/demos and vision roadmaps that were ultimately ready for a co-funded pilot with customers.As part of the deployment of the Innovation Lab, the newly formed team and I held training sessions for the digital platform, the innovation process guidelines, the innovation lab engagement model and types of work that the lab produced. We leveraged these sessions as feedback loops to evaluate the continuous evolution of what became an award-winning innovation lab in nine months.We quantified and validated our success to leadership by creating ROI metrics for the lab that included platform adoption rates, workshop to PoC to Pilot ratios, and net promoter score surveys. These proof points helped us grow the innovation lab year over year, both in size, scope and budget.Looking ahead to the merger with Wabtec (Westinghouse’s rail offspring), the new Wabtec + GE Transportation company is poised to become the 4th largest rail solutions provider in the world, behind the pending Siemens + Alstom merger and two Chinese behemoths. According to news reports, our customer base will double and our services will be complementary, exposing GE Transportation to Wabtec’s passenger rail customers and Wabtec to our freight logistics customers. Both companies will undergo a rapid period of growth together with renewed purpose, as we combine institutional expertise, revisit our organizational structures and operating procedures, and ask ourselves what and who we are meant to become. A spirit of innovation and an encouragement for change will be a requirement as we look inward and outward.Our next steps will be continuous improvement on success metrics, building an innovative culture across the organization at every level with a design thinking training program, and more cross-functional hires as we both enhance and evolve our offerings. We’ve already initiated partnerships with universities and design firms to act as a talent identification pipeline and to continuously keep a pulse on the latest and greatest innovations around the globe. Each of these new elements are part of our innovation roadmap, now and into our combined future.While my team and I are already making strides within GE Transportation, re-instilling the spirit of Thomas Edison into everything we do as an organization will be critical for us to push forward with our own guiding principles. We as a collective group of thinkers, tinkerers, researchers, hackers, philosophers, and explorers will need to embrace our own design-led and user-centric framework.Five learned principles:1. Always begin with your users. Having a deep empathic understanding for your users’ needs and desires is at the core of your success. Design-led (user-centered) approaches have been quantifiably proven to outperform other methods to innovation.2. Think big with north-star ecosystems and start small with phased deployment. The world we live in is increasingly complex, with a lot of variables that influence success of solutions to markets. Taking a holistic approach at the onset of any initiative forces you to think from an ecosystem perspective and reduces the blind spots that can attribute to myopic strategies. Phased deployment encourages iteration with proof points and lessons learned along the way to decrease unsustainable failures.3. Timing is everything. Understanding the maturity level of your organization, critical unmet needs and appetite for change helps prioritize the core elements that need to be deployed initially. This leads to higher adoption rates at the onset and helps tip the chasm of change more rapidly.4. Create champions. Early involvement of employees at every level creates buy-in and awareness. These early adopters act as catalyst for new initiatives.5. It’s a journey, not a destination. With this mindset, your failures will feel more like lessons learned and your successes will be achieved with more humility and a healthier perspective along the way.I’m looking forward to 2019 and the potentials of our new business. I can only hope if Thomas Edison were alive today, that he’d give my team and I a nod for taking risks and progressing our own experimental visions.----CRLeveilleExperience Design & Innovation Strategy Servant Leader, Writing Enthusiast and Olympian & World Champion Gold MedalistRyan LeveilleinCRLeveille--Ryan LeveilleinCRLeveille--Ryan LeveilleinCRLeveille--1Ryan LeveilleinCRLeveille--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Christina SainUX Planet--64HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ryan Leveille,https://medium.com/@crleveille,"13, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FxYjwATTPpP06HCH-Deh4w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*atLhAt_Xi16taubjWcikcA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zX5WOwrBL1dxXy3V2mZl7w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*MyZtshlIngOZrItiw595AQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*TguqDW-5qF3DX4PbmSL0kw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UDeFutvPKNGC3Idjoq9OIw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UgdiSHavF3pJzo4-pnQMCg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*PuLjPnuvQl4Eau0EREVOug.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3MkijVuJTdk_x0L5Ro5XOg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2abB7nWkGkdYT1K0mLO97A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8AbSRTc6fIZ1RzVEMQ6IHA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*t83cZwPZZ3BBPR4QKngNrA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*uTSwSQTa7qTAs5cjpCyiYA.png",20,70

Some examples of these IT services and workflows include business-to-business workflows, IoT, cloud services, artificial intelligence, and other emerging trends. In these contexts, Enterprise Architects and Quality engineers enhance the necessary end-to-end attention to quality attributes. Integrating methods and tools from Enterprise Architecture (EA), IT service management (ITSM), systems/software engineering, information security management, etc. is, therefore, imperative.Where in yesteryears independent actors acquired domain knowledge and acted on it in silos, today, there is a constant push to achieve IT/business alignment (ITBA). This collaborative process means that there needs to be a holistic consideration for:EA has gained traction as the disciplined, holistic and unified approach for managing the complexities in business and IT systems at a strategic level. Essentially, EA helps provide decision support for IT/business alignment (ITBA) to enterprise stakeholders (clients, employees, business manager, IT manager, Information manager, HR manager, project manager/project worker, logistics manager, financial manager, security manager, Chief Architects, CIO, CTO, and directors)EA is also well-known for its model-based methodology, that covers a broad range of phenomena as highlighted above. The purpose of the EA models is to help the variety of stakeholders to:The use of EA standards is significant in enabling organizations to effectively manage business and IT resources, (networks, hardware, software, data, and people) and provide a comprehensive overview of the inter-relationships within an enterprise.A good EA, therefore, considers the latest innovations in organizational structure, business processes, information systems and technologies with the definite purpose of enhancing efficiency, reliability, and timeliness. It includes the use of:Ultimately, EA should enable businesses to structure IT projects and policies to realize desired business outcomes that will allow the entire organization to manage disruptions and keep up with trends. Also, adopting EA should go beyond having a blueprint that describes:To make EA work, you need to apply the blueprint/concept to a structure. Basically, besides the blueprint, you also need to start a process, educate people and assign roles, create products, get the products approved, and then use the products.As such, EA mainly seeks to manage and maximize IT system qualities, business qualities and IT governance qualities.Some of the well-recognized IT-system quality attributes that should be managed throughout the lifecycle of the software/system include:Performance, or efficiency. How much work a system can perform and how fast in terms of scalability and responsiveness.Interoperability or the ability of multiple components or systems to exchange information and to use that information.Availability. How often a system is ready to deliver its services to its users.Security. How well a system can preserve integrity, availability, and confidentiality, of its internal information.Usability. How simple/convenient it is for a user to interact with and perform tasks in the system. It includes operability, learnability, understandability, and attractiveness of the IT-system.Accuracy. The degree to which the IT-system produces precise and accurate data. (Determined by comparing output values with real/expected values).Maintainability/modifiability. The ease with which an IT-system can be changed/adapted/modified to a changed environment, during its lifecycle. Its sub-qualities include integrability, portability, reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.Suitability of an IT-system is the degree to which the functionality of the system supports the system’s intended work tasks. Suitability is contingent on the systems functional characteristics like adequacy, implementation completeness, implementation coverage, and specification stability.Useful business qualities to consider include:Flexibility or the ability of a business (processes and organizational units) to adapt to changes in market conditions/requirements, e.g., demand, economic factors, politicsEfficiency or the ability to reduce time to accomplish business processes including manufacturing time, lead time, cycle time, work time, automation of work, etc.Effectiveness is the ability of the business to produce what the market demands while spending minimal time on administration and paperworkIntegration and coordination or the ability of organizational units in a company to synergize, e.g., coordination of production, sales, and distribution unitsDecision support or the capacity of a company to reinforce/enhance its decision-making process by making well-informed decisions, low uncertainty and high-reliability decisions, organization-wide accepted decisions, etc.Control and follow up encompasses the ability of the business to monitor, document, evaluate, modify and re-use decisions/implementationsOrganizational culture or the behaviors and value that contribute to the psychological and social well-being of the business including motivation, job satisfaction, stress, etc.Some widely used IT governance qualities include:Plan and organize. Addresses strategy and tactics, and is concerned with identifying how IT can contribute to the success of business objectives.Acquire and implement. Addresses the realization of the IT strategy; identifying, developing/acquiring IT solutions; and implementing and integrating IT strategy and solutions into business processes.Deliver and support. Addresses delivery of required services including service delivery; service support for users; management of data and operational facilities; and management of security and continuityMonitor and evaluate. Addresses governance, monitoring of internal control, performance management, and regulatory compliance to keep/improve quality and compliance with control requirements.Salesforce can manage and maximize several of the IT system qualities, business qualities and IT governance qualities that are necessary to implement enterprise architecture. At least, some Salesforce exponents certainly believe this to be possible. I concur with them, but only up to a point. Let me explain.If you twist my hand and ask for a simple answer to the question as to whether Salesforce can be used as a foundation for enterprise architecture. I would say, yes. But…The reality is not that plain and simple. Essentially, it depends on what your needs are.Salesforce was designed and built to be a CRM before anything else and is the preferred CRM solution for many enterprises. Moreover, due to several Salesforce-related initiatives, (including Salesforce AppExchange and the recently purchased MuleSoft that is used to provide integration solutions), some enthusiasts consider building applications on the Lightning/Force.com platform as a foundation for their enterprise architecture (EA).Salesforce proponents believe that it can be used as a foundation for building EA because it has most of the essential pieces in place to be rapidly deployed as a foundation for EA. These advocates suggest that Salesforce can be adapted to the following core tenets of a successful EA methodology.Despite these advantages of using Salesforce as the foundation for enterprise architecture, it is difficult to escape the fact that Salesforce also has its drawbacks as an EA platform. These drawbacks have to be considered when deciding whether Salesforce is suitable for your EA needs.Salesforce wasn’t built to be for EASalesforce was designed and built to be a CRM for sales management and not for EA. This means that integrating it into EA workflows can be challenging.Limited optionsWith Salesforce, you have limited deployment options, data center options, and cloud options. This means that if a technology that perfectly suits your needs appears on the market, all you can do is hope to see if Salesforce offers the technology as well. Also, if you are in a country that isn’t near a Salesforce data center, then you will very likely have performance issues including system downtime and service interruptions.Unnecessary functionality and excessive costIt’s quite easy to purchase unnecessary/redundant Salesforce functionality that you might not even need. Worse yet, since Salesforce is sold on a subscription basis, you will have recurrent costs that accumulate with time and that are difficult to justify. Furthermore, if you need additional integration through web service APIs, you will still need to pay more.Requires extra apps and developer customizationAlthough Salesforce is quite robust and powerful, if you need custom interfaces or additional functionality, then you can expect to use the services of a Salesforce developer to do the job for you. Over time, you will find that a complete or perfect solution will not only cost you a lot more in the long run, but it will lock you into a solution that becomes clunky as well. Also, once a company develops its own custom app on the Salesforce platform, they have to stick with Salesforce to protect their IT investment because the custom app is usually untransferable.Regulatory concernsData privacy and government compliance requirements may limit what you can do with Salesforce. For example, Salesforce only has about nine data centers and yet some countries do not allow companies to have customer data hosted in foreign countries.Other weaknesses of Salesforce as an application platformLightning Platform (formerly Force.com) has the following drawbacks:Salesforce AppExchange has the following drawbacks:One of the ways that Salesforce has tried to address deficiencies in its platform, with regards to enterprise architecture, is by absorbing MuleSoft. Through MuleSoft, Salesforce has gained an integration platform (Mule enterprise server bus and CloudHub), for connecting Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), SaaS, and enterprise applications.Through the Mule enterprise server bus (ESB), IT can integrate/translate data into a format required by consuming applications and to manage the IT protocol as well. Also, it allows for IT orchestration. Through the Mule ESB, Salesforce can promote reusability of IT capabilities and its governance.The problem is that, in a continually disruptive and changing environment, (where business users and customers frequently ask for changes), organizing source code around IT capabilities rather than business capabilities is not providing the long-term value that ESBs seek to address. This is why the ESB concept is quickly losing ground to the microservices concept or architecture style.Even if you choose to use the Mule ESB, you may still come across some challenges related to ESB implementation including:Ultimately, it is difficult to suggest one thing in particular that will cover the needs of all enterprises. Enterprise needs and resources are different which means that what may be suitable for one organization may not be ideal for another.Assessing your current state of affairs and considering future goals and then creating a well-thought-out EA methodology that suits your business is the best way forward to building a solid foundation.Doing so will allow you to directly address and manage IT-system quality, business quality, and IT-governance quality necessary to build a successful EA. In some cases, Salesforce will be a suitable solution for building your EA. However, creating your own EA from the ground up will be the best choice in most cases due to the following advantages.From our twenty-years of experience in project implementation, I can attest that Salesforce is not just a robust CRM platform but is also a worthy option for basing your enterprise architecture. The robustness and convenience that it offers make it a useful alternative to consider especially if you want to deploy rapidly. Nevertheless, it is inescapable that several other solutions were purpose-built for EA.Ideally, the best EA solution is one that has been built for EA from the ground up. Developing your own architecture or at least exploring and adopting a platform that was created with Enterprise Architecture in mind is the best choice to make in the long run.Check more articles here: https://tizbi.com/articles.----Tizbi is a custom software development company that provides its customers with reliable, efficient and affordable solutions: www.tizbi.comTizbi, Inc.--Tizbi, Inc.--Tizbi, Inc.--Tizbi, Inc.--Kruk Matias--Kruk Matias--Kate SteinmeyerinUX Design Club--1TechlettersinTech Force--2Shawn ShiinGeek Culture--3Yulia KosarenkoinBusiness, Architected--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech","Tizbi, Inc.",https://medium.com/,"7, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*CvZESf1gtiOFvL2A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*XFw1EZP0LbgYWzS6.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*r8dGF3q2EKB3xaV6.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*pBPwU3LEfZTnaVCO.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*qY0GV6F1vqHVCV8p.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*1FhOdNzd5VyyDN55.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*24g6RJWbDhcuoD1n.png",11,0

The use of digital currency has been done since the emergence of the first Bitcoin. Bitcoin paves the way for other digital currencies towards a bigger world of cryptocurrency. In the form of digital coins whose existence is shown through balances, digital currencies have reached a very wide use. Almost every field in the world now applies the use of digital transactions using cryptocurrency. The process is easy, safe, and fast becoming a handful of reasons why the use of this system is increasingly widespread. Transactions are digitally operated through blockchain technology which produces data containing details about the transactions carried out. These data are stored and visibility. Everyone can access the data with their own goals. On the one hand, this shows good faith because it supports the transparency of the process. But on the other hand, this actually becomes a threat that questions the level of privacy of a process.Privacy becomes a priceless thing in a transaction that takes place. This is because to avoid the bad possibility that could happen with the data visibility. Security is not only indicated during the transaction but the effect must also be felt for the long term. Transactions digitally are usually carried out with users who are not identified with certainty. This seems a little doubtful, but this is how privacy should be created. Users have the right to obtain privacy to ensure that every asset and activity they do in a digital transaction is unknown to others. Of course this has its own benefits, especially in providing greater protection. Highly trusted privacy support in transactions can be found on the Veil platform.Veil initiated the creation of a digital platform as a digital currency trading media that really prioritizes privacy. They assume, privacy is very important to be improved in a transaction process that will indirectly give birth to a better level of security personally. The embodiment of privacy in transactions is the work of Zerocoin and RingCT technology combined into one. Zerocoin has been applied first by Zcoin. This protocol has shown excellent data privacy. Each identity associated with the sender, recipient, and number of assets sent is not displayed. All information is also not traceable. In other words, transactions take place anonymously in the eyes of users in general. The shipping address and destination cannot even be found. This anonymity is meant as a very private transaction performance.RingCT as a technology combined with Zerocoin is also noted to have excellent advantages in terms of data anonymity. This function is directly supported through the use of sophisticated cryptographic methods so that it will close access by the wider community to transactions that take place within Veil. Efforts to improve process privacy were carried out by Veil through the creation of an anonymous coin. The use of this coin for each transaction is guaranteed to be safe and private. Even though data is generated from each transaction that has been validated, the data will only be seen and accessed by both parties concerned. This will increase data security in cyber and real crime prevention actions. The functions carried by Veil will cover the shortcomings that are usually found on other digital platforms that prioritize privacy but do not empower their networks. Veil not only supports transaction privacy but also contributes to creating an operable and competent performance.The transaction privacy system that is applied at least provides a benefit that leads to improving the quality of security with methods that are not commonly used. For some people, making transactions with a very high level of privacy raises different circumstances. To restore the usual transaction atmosphere that occurs on other digital platforms, Veil facilitates multi-block transactions that show transparency for users. The number of assets that they can send is also not limited. In the Zerocoin technology system, the number of transactions is limited to adjusting to the stipulated provisions regarding the calculation and size of transactions.Good privacy will support the good intentions shown by Veil. Process privacy will be supported at all times. This function will continue in the Veil technology network. All stages of the process are carried out independently by this platform without the support of software created by other parties. This also implies how Veil really prioritizes a very valuable privacy value on its platform by relying on its own strength to stand up and move forward through today’s leading digital platforms.Website: https://veil-project.com/Twitter: https://twitter.com/projectveilTelegram: https://t.me/VEILProjectTeam: https://veil-project.com/team/----Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Iman muda,https://medium.com/@imanmuda566,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*xNXjthy8nEyaoW7slkdBvw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Ft1h3bGjEvPGK_BiCdl5JQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*GXhHAAx1CE99pJBXjTPaOQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hCwQK5XlmtVHgsKEHO2PXw.png",4,0

The technology is transforming the way services and products get delivered, and redefining the guest experience by resolving the queries in real-time. The feature that IoT comes with makes it an essential asset for the hotel managers and owners.The tech comes with various advantages relevant to the hotel industry and helps in delivering a seamless customer experience with minimal energy costs. There are a few examples here that can help the hotel industry in improving its operations with the help of IoT.Increase in Productivity:Automation is considered as a crucial business trend that can help in utilizing time rightfully. As it is said, time and money go together, so both the aspects become utterly critical for the business. Hoteliers need to follow the same and automate the repetitive tasks performed by the employees to save time as well as increase their impulse and efficiency. Hoteliers can save a massive amount of money and increase the revenue by cutting down the staff and implementing IoT to attract more guests by lowering the costs. The initiative can enhance the guest experience of the hotel and turn them into loyal customers.Leveraging Customer Data:In the B2C companies, IoT provides customer data that was inaccessible before and allows the authorities to leverage the information. Apart from that, it also permits the company, serving other businesses to learn more about the customers and provide services as per their needs. On the other hand, data analysis and compilation allows interaction with technology and promotes the incorporation of the latest business models.Enhancing Accessibility and Speed:The execution of new technologies can take a little time to get into the system of the customers, so to keep the level of interest intact, hoteliers should be investing in voice controls. With the help of it, customers can find and order the required service instantly.Managing the Inventory:IoT renovates the way inventories are managed and taken care of in the hotel industry by making remote devices available to monitor the products on the catalog individually. Sooner or later, the smart devices might completely take over the inventory tracking and management by automating the repetitive tasks.Check This Out: Hospitality to the Next Level with IOT2.How Does AI Enhance Customer Experience?Technological evolution has led to a significant rise in digital customer expectations, and artificial intelligence is currently racing ahead to fulfill individual preferences. In the frontline of customer service, AI is capable of providing an instant response to the customer. AI-powered chatbot technology has the ability of sourcing data at a fast rate, while also adding real-time value to the employees. AI in customer service reduces repetitive, low-value interactions and also able to manage the frequently asked questions rather than sending to live employees.AI can monitor and manage the process through natural language input and internal integration that enhances the automation of repetitive tasks. Enterprises use robotic process automation to perform multiple repetitive tasks by effectively using software agents or ‘bots’ that automatically drive computer systems to save human needs.Organizations can benefit from the implementation of AI, as innovation is capable of enhancing new and existing customer interaction. With extensive customer-machine interactions, the technology provides practical suggestions for the immediate start of the company’s proactive engagement. By enabling this automation, enterprises can manage to cross-sell from an existing customer perspective based on models of granular customization and prediction.Source Link: Travel and Hospitality----I am a technology blogger, who loves to read and write on the latest in technology.Christopher--Christopher--Christopher--ChristopherinTechnology Innovations--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Christopher,https://medium.com/,2,3,0

At present, the HSN team has reached 100 members, 95% of which are experts and researchers in the field of Blockchain and 5G communications.HSN has completed the release of first generation of ecosystem application technology, White Paper Version 1, and has listed on five international exchanges. Our global community base has expanded to over 30 countries and regions around the world, supporting an incredible 100,000+ people.In order to accelerate the progress of the project’s research and development, HSN aims to continuously involve the community to participate and enable active members to participate in the further development and governance of our ecosystem. HSN wants to jointly promote the development of our 5G+blockchain ecosystem and share the return. Therefore, we launch the ‘Protector Master Node Plan’(PMN) recruitment program. The HSN Foundation allocates 5,000,000 HSN as reward to the PMN and referrals.Through specific token levels and long-term holding, users will support the development of HSN projects, participate in the ecological development, and receive exclusive benefits and interests.1. Deposit USDT in the official HSN wallet, exchange this into HSN and deposit it into the wallet’s personal account. A maximum of 10 million HSN is available for the initial PMN program. The wallet will exchange the USDT for HSN tokens according the actual market price in a timely manner. Submit the application for Protector Master Node qualification to participate in the PMN recruitment program. Each address is eligible to obtain one PMN status. According to the actual amount of participants, applicants obtain the certification of the corresponding level of Protector Master Node after approval of HSN project:2. After the Protector Master Node is successfully authenticated, the identity and related benefits are permanently valid.The first phase will start from the end of September 3rd 2019 (after HSN Wallet launch), onwards until a total of 10,000,000 HSN has been purchased.Conditions: If PMN participates in the “Valuation Adjustment Mechanism” , principal and giveaways rewards will be locked for 100 days.Rights: If the HSN/USDT price on the token release date is higher than the price on PMN certification date, all tokens are completely released;If the HSN/USDT price on the token release date is lower than the price on PMN certification date, the principal loss portion will be calculated, and the HSN token will be replenished according to (price on certification date — price on releasing date) / price on releasing date The loss of PMN principal due to the price drop is completely avoided.Protector Master Nodes are entitled to recommend new Protector Master Nodes. Protector Master Nodes of various levels will be able to receive the referral award according to the percentage listed below, for recommending others to deposit tokens and become new Protector Master Nodes.For example, one user (user A) becomes a Silver Protector Master Node by purchasing 3000 HSN tokens. When this node recommends another user (user B) to deposit 1000 HSN tokens and become Bronze Protector Master Node, then the User A will receive referral award of 1000*5%= 50 HSN.On September 3rd 2019, HSN officially launched the Protector Master Node(PMN) Program and releases its related Android and iOS versions of the HSN wallet.As the world’s first public chain + 5G ecological network, the purpose of HSN launching the PMN is to enable community members to contribute to the development of HSN, work closely together with the team and earn more HSN. The HSN foundation will allocate 5 million HSN tokens as a gift to the protector nodes and referrals.

175,4715,https://medium.com/swlh/how-our-startup-reached-40m-revenue-while-losing-email-subscribers-8c97358fc913?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,How our startup reached 8-figure revenue while losing email subscribers,The money is NOT in the list,"Tim Soulo (CMO @ Ahrefs)FollowThe Startup--13ListenShareDo you ever receive messages from strangers on Linkedin?Oftentimes, someone wants me to try their product, recommend their service or provide them with marketing advice.But, last week, I received a different kind of inquiry:After regularly visiting our company blog, Uffe had yet to encounter a single slide-in, pop-up or lead magnet. Considering the standardization of opt-in hacks, he was surprised.Visit Ahrefs’ blog, and you will see one form, located at the very bottom, right above the comments section, for collecting email addresses. That’s it.Here was my response:A quick search within our Intercom database revealed Uffe had indeed signed up for a paid trial several months ago.In other words, we never needed his email address. Our blog content was compelling enough to make the sale on its own.Every article we publish highlights the functionality of our software, while teaching readers how to become better SEOs.Our philosophy:Why focus on converting readers into leads, when you can focus on converting readers directly into customers?So far, it’s working.Over the past 3 years, Ahrefs has achieved +65% YoY growth (and 8-figure revenue) without opt-in hacks, lead magnets or nurturing sequences.The crazy part is — we’ve lost more email subscribers than we’ve gained, during that time.Check out our MailChimp stats below — note: We merged two lists in July, which created the appearance of a “boost.”Obviously, our philosophy directly contradicts the advice espoused by most online marketers, growth hackers and digital agencies.Hang around any seasoned marketer long enough, and you will probably hear him say: The money is in the list.Perhaps, some crazy successful marketer from the “direct-mail” era coined the moniker — no one knows.However, we don’t believe this philosophy is the most effective way to convert leads into paying customers today. Which is why we base our email marketing efforts on the following premises:It’s in solving problems.Let me explain.Were I was reporting to anyone other than Ahrefs CEO and founder Dmitry, I would probably get chastised for neglecting list-building tactics. However, Dmitry is a “product-first” guy.That means he prioritizes investing resources in continual feature improvements over executing on every marketing tactic there is. And these product capabilities inform the basis of our SEO-based marketing strategy.Again, our experience suggests the money is in solving problems via engaging content that:For this reason, Ahrefs ranks high in Google for many SEO-related searches. Search traffic that we get to our website and blog is our second biggest source of customers, only outperformed by the classic word of mouth.Here’s where traditional list-building tactics fall apart for me…Say someone lands on an article via Google search. They arrived seeking a specific piece of information.Why would we interrupt them when they are, voluntarily, reading an indirect, sales pitch for our software? The article they found is teaching them how to solve their exact problem with our toolkit.Our writers spend a TON of time ensuring each article we publish is exceptionally relevant, valuable and engaging. Directing attention away from something we worked hard to produce just seems dumb.As long as our ARR continues to climb, we’ll continue allocating resources toward what’s working. And, for us, that is creating content that promotes something we alone are qualified to deliver:An SEO toolkit that boasts the world’s largest index of live backlinks and second best web crawler after Google.Another surprising fact? Our email open rates are kinda sad.Check out the metrics from our last blast:According to the IBM 2016 Email Marketing Benchmark Study, the average email open rate in the United States is 21.5 percent.Hubspot conducted another sample of more than 25 million emails with an average open rate for “computer software” companies of 28 percent.Yikes — we’re 11 points below average. You might be wondering that’s because our actual emails are boring, irrelevant or ineffective. But comments like this suggest that’s not the case:Engaging in better list segmentation, inactive subscriber purging and other factors might improve our open rates. But such tasks aren’t a priority for our small marketing department. Why?Companies “doing everything right,” still fail to reach 30 percent of their audience. Put simply, our 10-person team doesn’t have time to waste effort on minimal gains.Our solution was to create an app notification feature; the bell icon alerts Ahrefs users whenever fresh content is published. Yes, we copied the idea from Facebook!Unfortunately, even this method of reaching customers is imperfect.Though our data shows the notifications perform better than emails, the overall reach is still quite low. Which is why we rely upon several other marketing methods to make sure our content reaches our audience.Ok, you may still be wondering:But why not, potentially, make your list even bigger? Why not use opt-in tricks?As previously mentioned, our CEO dislikes marketing “tricks” because they are disingenuous by design. But he also questions their effectiveness.For every visitor who subscribes via pop-up, you might annoy someone else away. Unfortunately, there is no definitive way to track how many potential customers are lost this way.However, I often come across case studies like this one about food blogger Nikki McGonigal.The foodie procured 1,375 percent more subscribers with a light-box pop-up than a sidebar opt-in, during an 8-month period. Clearly, the strategy sometimes works with elegant execution.However, that’s not what many online marketers seem to advocate. After receiving three pop-ups in quick succession, SEO Dan Petrovic said he abandoned marketer Neil Patel’s site in frustration.He shared his experience on social media with a post titled “How to lose audience in three easy steps.”Below are the pop-ups Petrovic is referring to in his post:Here’s the thing — Patel is marketing to a specific segment of marketers, and he’s proven through testing that these techniques work on them. That doesn’t necessarily mean they will work on your audience or mine.However, I think Ahrefs could improve its opt-in strategy with something in between the two previous examples.Right now, we utilize a “classic” subscriber form located at the bottom of each post. I suspect these forms are often overlooked, due to their widespread usage.After publishing this post, we’ll be experimenting with something more eye-catching — a discrete, slide-in form. However, the opt-in won’t appear until the reader reaches the bottom of the article.Could we entice readers with a freebie in exchange for providing their email addresses? Yeah, but we don’t want them to feel like “just another number” in our email lead nurturing sequence.Our goal is to maintain an email list of individuals who voluntarily signed up to receive notification of newly published articles — not a downloadable bribe.Setting and fulfilling clear expectations builds trust, and trust translates to sales.Our blog brings us new customers because we put 110 percent effort into creating content that solves their problem, while demonstrating the power of our platform.With this in mind, we don’t want to interrupt the reading experience we worked so hard to create. A pop-up requires someone to leave the site, check their Inbox, confirm their email address and refocus.Considering how much time and money we spend creating articles, why would we, voluntarily, direct potential customers away?The majority of our business comes from word of mouth. Our readers regularly recommend our content on platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn and Twitter.This wouldn’t happen if we distracted them with enticing freebies, before unexpectedly inundating them with “lead nurturing” emails.Translation: Giving people exactly what they came for is everything.Finally, the ultimate downside of “growing your list at all costs” might be the cost of maintaining it. Email service providers like Mailchimp commonly offer scaling price plans based on “number of emails sent.”This is a really bad deal considering less than 30 percent of subscribers are opening the average business’ emails. Check out this notification we received recently because we ran out of credits:Fail to set-up “double opt-ins” — where subscribers must click on an emailed confirmation link before joining — and you’re, potentially, leaving even more money on the table.Why doesn’t Mailchimp charge based on “number of emails opened?” I’m not sure, but paying for something that consistently delivers low ROI should always be questioned.It’s in our ability to solve problems with valuable content that promotes our product while drawing organic search traffic. Right now, our buyer’s journey looks like this:This simple sequence works because the person wants to put into action what he or she just read about.Engaging in email funnel optimization would add two extra steps to the journey — email confirmation and additional email engagement — that would prolong the visitor from their main objective after reading the article: Playing with the software!What about you? How do you approach list building? What sort of results have you experienced with pop-ups, sliders and more?Let me know in the comments below.//Thanks for reading.

176,12488,https://medium.com/meetbitfury/how-blockchain-can-strengthen-the-music-industry-209d136be396?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,How Blockchain Can Strengthen the Music Industry,Geographic distance is no longer an issue,"Bitfury SurroundFollow--ListenShareThe production of music is the ultimate expression of artistic creativity. Musicians, songwriters, producers and others come together to express their passion through music. While this is a truly creative and inspirational process, it also includes many routine business processes like copyright, distribution and licensing. Professional creators work hard in a cut-throat environment to produce art in spite of the industry’s many challenges. Blockchain, however, can help alleviate these challenges and reinvigorate the creative process.The industry developed as a result of automation and other technological advances. The CD was the music industry’s first step into digitization. This development created new opportunities and challenges, and new rules gradually evolved about how to control and regulate these new forms of art.However, the issue of international distribution was becoming more and more problematic. Music markets used to be geographically limited, with advertising focused on the audience in the country or region in which the artist lived. Forms of distribution included sheet music and then recordings in the form of vinyl discs, cassettes, and then CDs. Music labels then created these distribution channels by financing recordings, their reproduction, and their distribution across markets. Because countries have their own legislation and regulation about music distribution, music labels had to partner with international counterparts to expand their distribution around the globe. As a result, an international network was created to organize the use and marketing of musical content in their respective territories.Unfortunately, this network had its vulnerabilities, and it significantly suffered from illegal import of music recordings and unauthorized reproductions sold on the black market. Additionally, the royalty payments from legitimate music distribution channels in this international network were often delayed and difficult to audit and even retrieve. Even today, the royalty system faces a number of challenges. Collecting societies cannot control when a song by their artist is played. As a result, the artists cannot be sure they are receiving a fair reward. In their turn, labels are struggling with how to understand the data from streaming service providers and how to bill them correctly.The interaction and relationships between the music industry players themselves also became increasingly difficult to disentangle. In the creation of a single piece of digital content, more than 100 people could be involved in the project. For example:Artists perform songs, and they can either partake in the song creation process or perform the works by authors who write lyrics and compose music for musical content.Labels, for their part, finance the production, marketing and distribution of musical records.Collecting societies facilitate the distribution of musical content and help avoid the need for the labels to sign contracts with each individual songwriter. They represent a collective of authors, negotiate royalty rates on their behalf, license their copyrighted works, collect royalties and distribute the royalties to their members. The collecting societies not only give out licenses to labels, but also license all instances when a work by their author is used — be it in radio or public TV, in a restaurant, at the hairdressers or any other place.Publishers, for a percentage, make sure that authors’ works are used by performing artists, in films or advertising and help with promotion at radio stations.Digital music aggregators are a driving force in the industry since physical sales became less important. The success of an artist depends on their success on the platforms at the moment as well as how they are marketed on them.All these people work toward the same goal of making music, building a brand and distributing the work. But a number of them stand between the content creator and consumers, each staking their own claim on the profits. There is thus friction between these various parties even as they work together, as there is no fixed framework for successful cooperation between authors and artists and all the other organizations. This usually results in content creators receiving only a small portion of the profits for their work, increasing distrust of the system by everyone involved.As an additional layer of complexity, internet giants have made themselves into an intermediary between the artists and their audiences. The rise of the internet has given the music industry instant access to a global audience. However, only a few of the millions of options for sharing music can help the industry generate the user attention it needs. Internet giants have commoditized access to the audience, but often require redistribution or ownership rights from the creators. Additionally, the internet giants rarely take responsibility for copyright infringements, viewing themselves as intermediaries without responsibility in this regard.The internet companies also have a monopoly on statistics. There is no way to verify the statistics generated and sold by the portals, which is how many artists gauge their popularity and plan their financial strategy. Artists and their partners can bargain for their interests only by collectively exerting pressure for access to this information.Even with the advent of the internet, creators are still stymied by industry bottlenecks created by music labels and other marketing channels. Until the early 2000s, the music labels were the main obstacle for artist exposure, as they were the only financial partners for recordings, marketing and distribution — and each label could only handle so many clients. Today, the main obstacle for artists is the opposite — with many channels offering direct access to their fans, artists are struggling to find ways to stand out amongst their competition.But here’s the good news: Blockchain technology offers many features that can alleviate these problems.Blockchain technology is an ingenious combination of time-tested advances in cryptography and computer science. At its heart, the technology is literally a chain of blocks of data cryptographically linked together, with each consequent block referencing the previous one. If you were to try to replace a block, you would “break” the chain and invalidate the cryptography. This would be immediately noticed and rejected by the network. It is why the blockchain recording the transactions of bitcoin has never been hacked in its 10+ years of existence.Blockchain offers immutability of the records it keeps, as the blocks of a blockchain cannot be substituted. This simple quality has far-reaching implications:Trusted auditability: Any statement about data stored on a blockchain can be verified immediately.Transparency: If a change happens on the blockchain, there is no way it can be hidden or obfuscated.By keeping records of the blockchain in multiple places, the record is strengthened and protected from technological failure or bad actors. If one computer fails, the records are not lost or compromised.In this way, blockchain creates technological trust: any statement about the data on the blockchain can be verified and kept safe.Another great aspect of blockchain is its ability to run a piece of code known as a “smart contract.” When a smart contract is recorded in the blockchain, it is unhackable, unchangeable and instantly executed.There are multiple applications of smart contracts, but some of the major ones for the music industry include compliance and royalty payments.This unique combination of features is perfectly suited to address challenges inherent to the musical industry.Blockchain networks can operate anywhere with an internet connection, and the records of the blockchain can be stored anywhere in the world. Data exchanged is immediately recorded and can be audited at any time — whether its content licensing information or international payments — because the blockchain system is accessible 24/7.All data stored on the blockchain is verifiable and protected by cryptography. The parties in a blockchain system do not need to rely on blind trust to interact with each other, as they can now rely on the blockchain’s algorithms to keep their data safe and immutable while keeping the actions of other parties transparent.Complex royalty distribution schemes can now be implemented as a simple smart contract, the conditions of which are negotiated upfront and digitally enforced. Smart contracts can be designed for user privacy as well — with each party only having access to the information that pertains to their part in a royalty arrangement.There are no intermediaries in a blockchain network. All participants are equal and have equal access to the data shared, unless specifically designed otherwise. If a blockchain were used to record statistics, for example, the statistics would be permanently recorded and available to anyone in the system. Another benefit of blockchain is that censorship is not an option. All parties of a blockchain network are equal and have the same influence on the state of affairs — no party has more power than the others. This allows for more equal footing across the board no matter the scope of the blockchain, whether it’s for recording and sharing statistics, processing royalty payments, or tracking copyrights.As you can see, blockchain technology can greatly benefit the music industry by making its processes more transparent and helping participants get a fair reward for their work even in the internet age.

At the forefront of mitigating these risks are VR designers and developers who navigate the field using their own moral compasses.In an exploratory study, developers expressed the need for standards and ethical guidance. In response, researchers led a co-design of a code of ethics together with VR developers. The researchers recommended initial guidelines which developers themselves expanded into the following code of ethics.Professionals involved in the development of VR experiences have the duty to:Ensure that the intensity of the VR experience and its effects are appropriate by thorough testing. Avoid creating content that objectifies, demeans, or violates the rights of humans or animals.Use the best security protocols and protections to ensure that malicious actors cannot alter or harm users while they are in the VR experience.Ensure that app privacy policies specifically mention VR data and how that data will be used, shared, and protected.Include permission requests for sensitive data such as eye-tracking, health, and other biometric information including movement-derived data.Apply best practices to reduce nausea among users and test all products before releasing them to the general public.Provide a diverse set of avatars to users and ensure that representations of groups and characters do not perpetuate stereotypes.Prevent cyberbullying and sexual harassment and ensure inclusivity through community guidelines and privacy protections. Projects involving children or other vulnerable populations deserve special consideration.Include options for those without standard vision, hearing, or movement to enable them to participate meaningfully in VR experiences. For example, allow users to integrate additional software or hardware as needed through modular design.Seek out and implement new methods to enhance the immersive and seamless experience provided to users. Do not consider end-users as entirely separate; act in collaboration and symbiosis with them to achieve the best possible experience.In a separate research, Gray and Chivukula identified three mediators or influences in ethical design practice: individual values, company policies, and the available information on applied ethics. This guide serves as the third.For this code of ethics to be effective, designers and developers need to incorporate its spirit to their own personal standards and advocate for its dissemination within their companies. One concrete step is to discuss this code of ethics within your team and decide how you could apply it in your practice.References:Adams, Devon, et al.

If you were wondering why that is but have not taken the time to figure it out, you didn’t do it right. You were supposed to Google it to learn that there is a humanitarian crisis happening in Sudan.The trend has been taking root since it was first proposed by humanitarian, Remaz Mahgoub Khalaleyal through his Instagram account, @reresolve. It’s in response to media indifference from the west and a social media blackout in Sudan. So far it’s been adopted by celebrities like Demi Lovato, Rihanna and Ariana Grande.Social media for good is always an amazing thing. It has the power and influence to bring about some real change in the world. Just don’t forget to use all of the power that you have to help your the Sudanese people suffering abuses at the hands of their government. If you want to help, donate here.On Wednesday this week, the unthinkable happened: Facebook went down and it took Instagram and Whatsapp with it. Well, not completely. Some photos and videos on the apps had difficulty loading. Still, the outage was enough to have social media junkies up in arms. They were forced to do whatever it was that we all did before Instagram for a day. Not the end of the world. Still, there was a palpable sense of dread in the air with no end to the outage in plain sight. Would our favourite social media channels be down forever??? If so, how would we survive? It felt like a brief return to the stone age.But how, could this possibly be considered a weekly win, you may, justifiably, be asking yourself.Well, just one day later, all functionalities were restored and we found ourselves back in social media-land. It turns out that it was a minor issue that occurred during maintenance that knocked some of the functions out.Scary to think that our treasure troves of memories could be wiped out with a minor hiccup but for the time being, all’s well that ends well.One interesting thing that came from the Facebook outage was a bit of insight into the AI picture labeling system that Facebook employs.In short, what we got a glimpse into is the image tags that exist behind every one of our uploaded photos.So instead of seeing our pics on Wednesday, we saw descriptors like, ‘May be: nature scene’ or ‘people and dog’.Weirdly, and somewhat creepily, names were often included too, due to Facebook’s facial recognition algorithm.A glimpse behind the digital curtain was pretty neat. Many a man found themselves reduced to their most basic qualities, specifically, ‘one person, beard’.Instagram’s stickers function just keeps on evolving. This week Instagram announced that stories would allow users to create group chats with stickers.The sticker, labeled ‘let’s chat’ could be applied to their story. Audience members that click on the sticker will be directed to the chat, which is moderated by the story creator.This newest addition to the story function is just one more way that Instagram is letting its users interact with the community that they’ve cultivated.Let’s keep the Instagram theme going, shall we?After abstaining for years, actor Jake Gyllenhall decided to join Instagram this year after deciding that ‘no one cares about anything anymore.’ It could be easily said that no one cares about anything anymore since the news cycle is about four minutes long and it’s even shorter in the social media world. In particular, a certain leader of the free world seems to be able to get away with just about anything, so Jake’s is a fair assessment.People love it when celebrities seem just like regular people. It turns out that Jake Gyllenhall is pretty funny. If you’d like to be amongst the 300 million people that follow him on Instagram, click here.----Hello! We are Pound & Grain.

Eating out for a photo, traveling for a photo, squandering money for a photo — and it has become this dystopian society of deceit.Studies have shown that people who frequently and/or intensely use social media tend to have a lower self-esteem or depressive symptoms, especially when seeing images of people “living the life.”And while some people use social media as an outlet for a cause or to raise awareness, many others use it to showcase an unrealistic and deceiving scenario. Is the person we see on the screen the same person they say they are behind the screen?When ‘likability’ suddenly became importantUsing social media as an outlet to express yourself is acceptable. But when you allow social media to take over your life and become the definition of who you are as a person, it can be a bit concerning.You are more likely to paint a false picture or narrative of a life you want others to think you have. You begin to form excuses and so-called ‘sacrifices’ of spending more money on aesthetics, paying more than what you’re receiving, to go above and beyond — but for what cause?Most social media influencers try to make their lifestyle the goal for others. They have normalized certain things — wasting money and food, giving in to unsustainable consumption, and mindlessly encouraging status and ego gratification.In its original series, Black Mirror, Netflix released an episode entitled Nosedive. Charlie Brooker, the writer and creator of Nosedive, describes the episode as a satire on acceptance and “the image of ourselves we like to portray and project to others.”The main character of Nosedive, Lacie, has essentially lived her life trying to please everyone to get “higher social points.” She believes that her value as a human being equates to the value of her “points” or, in this case, “likes” in social media.Many have fallen for the trap. People post things about themselves, that aren’t entirely true, thus allowing ‘followers’ and ‘friends’ to judge them for the lives that they want others to think they have.Let’s take, for instance, a scenario where you’re out for lunch with a friend who deeply cares about his/her social presence. You’re starving. The food comes, and you just want to dig in. But your friend is taking a while, finding the best lighting and searching for the best angle. Minutes have passed, and they finally tell you to touch your food. Yet, their eyes are still glued to their device figuring out the best way to make the photo look aesthetically pleasing (so much for catching up).It is a deception, and it is a practice that’s taken further by influencers in Instagram and YouTube, particularly those focused on fashion, travel and lifestyle blogging.When influencers create content that showcases a luxurious and glamorous lifestyle, it can be menacing for others. They are called ‘influencers’ for a reason. It has proliferated, and it can be dangerous.Encouraging people that they, too, can travel the world and see places does not really take into account that the only wealth some people have is to dream as they struggle to pay their next rent.Inflating the truthWhat even are ‘influencers’? A recent study from Olapic defines an influencer as someone with over 10,000 followers, whom brands engage with to help promote their products, services or messages, who shares information about products they love and who is an expert in their field — in this case, social media.The study also reveals a central theme: authenticity. What makes a consumer trust an influencer? Do influencers use social media for profit? Do they promote things in dishonest ways? Are they sincere about their virtual engagements and interactions? How can they guarantee that the product their promoting is what they say it is?While it has reached a point of no return, the return on investment, however, for a company who uses social media influencers to reach other consumers has improved. Although social media is a revolutionary innovation that allows online-users to share their thoughts, post photos and connect with others around the world, there is no hiding behind the screen that it can be toxic and perilous.The Fyre Festival fiasco is a perfect example. The infamous event has been archived by two documentaries in both Hulu and Netflix. The biggest marketing tool that pushed the disaster? Social media.Billy McFarland, the young entrepreneur who started it all, roped in high profile social media influencers and created an astounding media campaign that allured people into thinking that Fyre Festival would be the best event of the century.“All advertising is premised on the selling of an idea but the efficiency with which social influencers inculcate inadequacy in their followers, then sell them products and experiences to fix their sad little lives, is creepier than anything that predates it,” says The Guardian’s Emma Brockes.The whole debacle was indicative of two things 1) it is this easy for social media influencers to send any message to their followers, and 2) the power of people who promote a fantasy version of their lives is stronger than we think.“Ridiculous,” people are saying on Twitter. Indeed, social media influencers will go through extreme measures such as buying an overpriced avocado toast and latte for a photo they didn’t get to eat or giving into manipulation because they rode a private yacht or sipped Mai Thai’s in a private island in the Bahamas for free — all in the name of content, personal image and entertainment.Erin Vogel, a postdoc in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, studying social media and well-being, spoke with media outlet Salon.“A lot of my research is based on this idea that people present selectively positive versions of themselves in social media — they’re talking more about the better aspect of their lives and making themselves seem like they’re having this great life, which can then lead other people to feel worse about themselves as a result.”This is a no-brainer: on social media, people portray themselves in a way that they aren’t genuinely portrayed in real life. They deceive followers into thinking that this is the perfect life — a must-have or a life goal.It is safe to assume that what you see on screen is not the same person behind the screen. People hide behind filters and presets to come up with the best quality and versions of themselves — sometimes, far from the truth.----Rachel Ramirez is a New York-based journalist from the island of Saipan.

Whilst this issue is of principal concern to those seeking immediate trade opportunities such as investors, traders, and businesses, failure to prepare and execute adequately could see detrimental effects filter throughout our society. In addition, established monikers such as BRICS, CIVETS, and MINT could present complications such as higher prices when the UK is no longer a member of a mega trading block. In a post-Brexit world, access to advantage foresight will enable UK businesses to secure first mover advantage in new markets before they are discovered by their peers. Pinpointing the location and likely timing entry points of future trading potential are the unknowns that AMPLYFI’s research aimed to uncover — helping businesses predict and prepare for the future disruptions Brexit may cause.Using DataVoyant™, the world’s leading AI-powered business intelligence tool, AMPLYFI is able to detect early signals for any emerging trend or topic; giving users a head-start on their competitors when it comes to strategic decisions. We directed this capability at predicting the likely future trade destination opportunities for the UK post-Brexit.What were the results?DataVoyant™ searched the internet and found 410,000 documents that featured Brexit. 334,000 of them were either published from the UK (.co.uk domain) or the US (.com domain). Removing all source content from these sites from the final analysis ensured a corpus of documents focused on non-UK and non-US content that revealed genuine potential trade interests for the UK post-Brexit. In the first instance, the leading countries that have been discussing Brexit are Ireland, Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, and India.The corpus was then analysed to identify countries that discussed trade in a positive light in the context of Brexit in their published documents; a strong indicator that they are considering and acknowledging the UK’s future trade potential. Out of these Nigeria showed the highest links, with 32% of its documents linking Brexit to trade — considerable as the global average was 20%. Nigeria was followed by Japan (31.5%), South Africa (30.4%), Singapore (29.1%) and Canada (28.3%). The results are particularly interesting in that two of the top three are African and none of the top five are European. This provides one indicator as to markets that are most likely to emerge as holding the greatest potential for the UK to grow trade with post-Brexit. Deeper analysis also revealed which industries, sectors, and products are likely to benefit most from each strengthening relationship.How does it work?DataVoyant™ is just one of AMPLYFI’s broader suite of AI-powered business intelligence platforms. It combines leading Surface and Deep Web searching and mining with machine-driven data curation and analysis to simplify Big Data for users via compelling and intuitive visualisations. Standard search engines do not access the Deep Web where significantly more information is buried.

From adjusting the antenna on a blank and white television to watching LIVE sports on handheld devices in full HD, there is no slowing down for innovation. The technology breakthrough and ease of access to innovative products have made the customer smarter and empowered him with choices. Evidently, the boom in technology has helped accelerate sales for service providers as customers are finding new ways to interact with their preferred brand or a company. Being omni-channel has certainly helped in the process of retaining a loyal relationship between the provider and the buyer. As more and more companies are competing with respect to ease of availability for the customers, managing systems has become crucial and a tedious task.The companies are receiving a lot of data every minute that is mostly ignored because they are not equipped to handle such large volumes. The collection of data, processing, structuring, analyzing and extracting meaningful information is a time-consuming process that adds to the company’s operational expenses. This loss of valuable time affects strategic planning which leads to customers moving to competitors. The other problem that comes with the unavailability of an intelligent system is the possibility of human errors and overlooking unethical activities that cause losses to the company not only in terms of revenue but also its reputation. Financial institutions are one of the biggest industries facing these challenges.The onus comes on the service providers to seamlessly serve their King in the best way possible while keeping the integrity of the company intact. The customers are getting to a point where they will easily switch their loyalty if their demands are not fulfilled. Slowly, companies are adapting Artificial Intelligence technology to help overcome these issues and help increase the agent’s productivity by automating various time-consuming processes.The use of a strong machine learning algorithm that drives AI into making informed decisions is transforming the finance industry in various ways. Some are as below:The basis of AI technology is learning from past data, hence, the implementation of AI in the financial institution is destined to succeed. For a company that sells credit cards, a credit score is used as a deciding factor to identify who is eligible and who isn’t. For providing a customized interest rate on a credit card, the company can use the individual’s data such as loan repayment habit, number of active loans, the number of active credit cards, etc. AI with deep learning finds its place here as it has the capability of going through thousands of personal financial records and providing a figure quickly and accurately.AI is functioning as a data analyst to save millions by eliminating inaccuracies. AI tech is powered by machine learning algorithms that can learn over time and analyze a vast amount of data has established itself in areas which require analytical and clear thinking.Financial institutions, like all businesses, aim to reduce the various risk conditions. Banks provide loans to an individual/organization at an interest. This money being provided by the bank is actually someone else’s money. Hence, the banking industry takes fraud extremely seriously. AI comes to the rescue here as it uses the past spending habits on various transactions to detect any unusual behavior such as swiping a card from another country shortly after it has been used elsewhere.The other reason why AI is widely used to detect fraud is because of its deep learning algorithms. For example, if it flags a regular transaction and the human agent corrects it, AI learns from this experience and makes more sophisticated conclusions next time.Having an omni-channel presence comes with its own pros and cons. One of the widely known disadvantages is the customer’s outburst on the Social Media platform. Companies have to be very careful in dealing with such instances because social media is such a platform that can make and (easily) break a company’s reputation. AI has proven to be a savior that can spin this situation into a positive experience.Deep learning has improved the machine’s ability to understand a query and give an appropriate response. The companies can find the opinions and views of their customers on various social media channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. This data is fed through machine learning algorithms to understand the customer sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) to provide an appropriate response. This happens so smoothly in the background that a customer posting the query might not know that he is speaking to a Bot unless explicitly mentioned.Predictions are an integral part of trading. As a lot of money is involved in trading, it is important to predict the future of the market as accurately as possible. Using AI, machines can be fed with a huge amount of data and they can be taught to observe the pattern in historical data and predict the repeatability of the same in the future. We have the data of the financial crisis that occurred in 2008 which can be made available to the machine learning algorithms to learn the anomalies. This way, AI can detect similar anomalies when they come across in future and plan strategies around the same.Also, for individual traders, the AI can suggest portfolios depending on the person’s risk taking capacity. For someone with the high-risk appetite, the AI can suggest when to buy, hold or sell a stock. For low-risk takers, AI can give an alert if the market is expected to fall and then take a decision to stay with the investment or get out.Managing finances is a challenging task due to its complex nature, hence, AI is also used here for managing the same. Personal financial management is one of the recent developments on the AI based wallet. A San Francisco startup has created an e-wallet that uses machine learning algorithms to help individuals make smart and informed decisions about spends. The AI basically scans through the customer’s web footprint and learns from the past transactions to create spending graphs. This not only helps the consumer in making the right decision to manage finances but also saves the time of creating lengthy spreadsheets to track expenditure. From small scale investments to large scale, AI is being used to manage finances and optimize spending habits.There is no iota of doubt that AI will continue to evolve, and its business applications will keep growing. The manual operations in the financial ecosystem could be a thing of the past with AI taking informed business decisions and involving humans only in rare cases of disputes. This technology will also allow the assets and wealth management managers to focus on client relationships and strategic planning.----Engagely.aiinChatbots Life--Engagely.ai--Engagely.ai--Engagely.ai--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Engagely.ai,https://medium.com/,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*X8RYswnE-37UYTY0Op_ZOA.png",5,0

Now imagine if you could click on products and explore them in store like you do online. Think about all the information online (ratings, reviews, pictures, people who bought other items, how to use, etc) that is a simple click, tap, or page scroll away. With all this rich content available why do retailers continue to just throw products in a store and offer no insights? Just products on nice displays, shelves and racks with no clear way to explore or find information on brands. How can brands tell their story or continue their story in the current retail environment? All that rich content companies spend millions on to create and put online but it is missing in-store, so the question to ask now is how do they get it offline, online-to-offline attribution?The mobile revolution is well underway and many retailers were told or have thought that this would be a technology that could and would help retail. But unfortunately, it hasn’t been able to help in the ways originally hoped for many reasons and mobile has brought more of a dilemma than a Saving Grace and here are a few of the main key insights to why:· App penetration average is less than 10% of customer base· User acquisition is expensive· Shopping experience is and remains dull· More than likely going to compare with amazon appSo how do you solve the dilemma of mobile and digital and in-store? How do you create engagement and experiences with products? Research and studies have shown that when buyers can touch your product they are 40% — 60% more likely to buy it and if they hold product for 40 seconds or more people value that product up to 70% more. The influence of product touch and interaction is super powerful and shouldn’t be over looked.CURRENT RETAILER APPROACH TO PHYSICAL + DIGITAL TRENDSWith today’s current organization structure brands/retailers mostly have their Technology & Operations focused on store-wide operations (check out, analytics, supply-chain, CRM and loyalty). These technologies that affect entire store, supply chain and predicative analytics, and Mobile Apps are all managed in silo’s. While the in-store experience is usually driven by GMM’s (General Merchandising Managers) and category Managers along with design.Deriving value via dwell time, reduced sales associate expense, multi-channel shopping and endless aisle solutions is virtually non-existent and if it does exist the reports are isolated and take way too long to get. And by the time any insights can be extracted it’s to late. The tools used to engage customers are in every Silo and none of them are speaking to each other.BRAND APPROACH TO PHYSICAL + DIGITALHow do brands stand out on shelf from their competitors? All that brand messaging that doesn’t make it in store and further more can brands really rely on instore sales associates to tell their story? Brand’s are still relying on dated methods to focus on making their products stand out with consistent brand messaging using existing in-store content investments (shelf space, shelf blades, neck ties, displays, posters, etc).Shopper marketing groups are still focused on sales lift and ROI mainly. Their primary focus remains on the arrows in their reports. Their main concern still remains that products are selling. While more sophisticated clients focus on analytics and new found visibility like ‘What’s the reason why people pick up and don’t buy’. Many just care about the immediate experience without metrics for events and one-off campaigns. Brands are getting premium real-estate for free from retailers because of joint benefits, the more a brand does the more store space retailers are likely to give.THE STORE BECOMES/IS NEW MEDIAIt is time to start to think about the way in which we look at and approach the retail space. We need to change the perception in how we look at bricks & mortar and start to look at stores as Media, a physical store is essentially Media an extremely under utilized one. The fact that people are instore physically interacting with brands and there continues to be little done about this is stifling. Meanwhile these brands will continue to spend millions on media hoping consumers will visit their website, Facebook page, or any other social outlet. The fact that Brands aren’t looking at this or using this as an effective media outlet when real live customers are right their just feet away from the point of sale is a question I am constantly asking myself.In this new idea where store is media it identifies your Customers and views customers as the central focus and essentially, they’re the driving factor. Moving from Multi-Channel to Omni-Channel (Omni-Channel a word often over used and misunderstood) is no easy task but being able to identify that all channels being integrated and communicating with each other WILL be one of the most important drivers in moving your CXM forward.If Brands/Retailers don’t have their media at the point of sale where people are touching and investigating their products that they spent millions of dollars on why aren’t they thinking about that? Did you know that there are ten times the amount of people facing your products in bricks and mortar stores than on Brand Facebook Pages? Brands and Retailers are spending their media dollars on hoping people see their products online but this is not the case in-store where people are touching and holding their products. Have you thought of this? What would you pay on a dollar basis to deliver your content media to them exactly as they touch a product? Delivering digital instore if done correctly with a platform and at scale is cheaper than to delivering digitally to your Facebook Page or Instagram account.Brands need to start to think about how they approach the Physical + Digital idea. They need to think about; what is right media at the point of physical shopping? They need to rethink the metrics to what they measure success (sales by square ft’ is no longer pertinent in todays world). Brands need to think about online-to-offline attribution and how this digital content can be used in store to close the life cycle of the shopper. Here are some new key metrics that can used instead to better measure in store success:· Sales lift· Cost per click· Cost per email/mobile CPA· Value of earned media· Traffic conversion to website (browsing instore and buying online)· Free Premium Space/ end caps· Analytics visibility in-store (additional in store analytic tools)Add to this with focusing on meaningful/qualitative customer data via surveys, feedback from customer interviews. Use your customers to get it right after all they’re usually your biggest fans. They should and will give you the meaningful data you need to know if your CX approach will be successful.In closing the art of creating and executing highly engineered CX Strategies is to make them as seamless as possible and to have them appear as if they didn’t require any highly innovative thought engineering at all. Achieving this on the other hand is anything but easy, they require meticulous level of thought, planning, leadership, collaboration, perseverance and measurement. Offering truly amazing Customer Experiences are as invigorating to brands/retailers as they are to travelers ascending upon a new destination and discovering something new and creating a road map for your CX now will be one of the most important decisions your Brand will make now in order to help secure it’s success in the future.3 PART SERIES HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY- Focus on what’s driving the merging of Physical+Digital retail, Millennials and the experience driven economy- Focus on the frictions and joys in your Brand’s shopping process (how many smiles generated)- Recognize this is an organizational challenge as much as a technical one- Success requires definitive tests and measurement to justify a meaningful roll out and it’s impactADDITIONAL CX RESEARCH & INSIGHTSThe following stats put into perspective just how important a customer experience focus and CXM is to a company’s future success.1.

Regulators still need to approve the purchase in the fifteen countries where Careem operates, and while that shouldn’t be a problem in many of them, Egypt could be a major roadblock.Under the deal, Uber and Careem will continue to operate as separate brands, but the new monopoly will allow the ride-hailing companies to raise prices since competition will be an illusion. This is a change from Uber’s usual approach to major competitors, having previously sold its operations in China to DiDi, Russia to Yandex.Taxi, and Southeast Asia to Grab, but not a change in the monopolistic tendencies of the industry. Uber has already announced its intention to become the “Amazon for transportation,” inspired by its platform monopoly in e-commerce.Careem operates across the Greater Middle East, which spans from Pakistan in the east to Morocco in the west. Approval shouldn’t be a problem in Saudi Arabia, where investors are due to see handsome profits from the acquisition, nor in Careem’s home country, the United Arab Emirates, where Skeikh Mohammed said the announcement showed the success of Dubai’s Internet City and that tech companies can flourish in “the ‘desert’ of Dubai.”In contrast, taxi drivers in Turkey took to the streets to protest the deal. It remains to be seen how Turkish and other authorities will respond to the proposed purchase, but Egypt’s regulators have already made their position known.The Egyptian Competition Authority confirmed it received formal communication of the deal on Tuesday. In September 2018, after rumors of merger talks were first reported, the ECA warned Uber and Careem that pursuing a merger or any agreement that would restrict competition would be in violation of Egyptian law. Both Uber and Careem were also temporarily banned from operating in Egypt from March to April 2018 after a lawsuit was filed by taxi drivers.The Egyptian Competition Agency warned Uber and Careem that a merger or any other agreement to restrict competition would be in violation of Egyptian law.In 2017, Uber said that Egypt was one of its fastest-growing markets and opened a $20-million support center to expand its operations across the African continent. Cairo is also the test market for on-demand minibus services launched by Uber and Careem in December 2018. UberBus has just two limited routes which run close to existing and planned metro lines, while Careem’s offering seems to have a wider service area. It plans to expand bus services to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.The Uber-Careem merger is clearly designed to please investors ahead of Uber’s planned IPO, which could come as soon as April 2019, especially as the company seems unable to show how it will ever be profitable. Monopolizing markets where it faces fierce competition, or getting out of them as it did in the past, is a way for Uber to prove it’s trying to address the issue.But while higher fares and monopoly might sound good to shareholders, it’s in clear violation of the rules the ECA will apply when it assesses the merger, which means there’s a fight ahead for Uber in Egypt. That begs another question though: as long as the deal isn’t canceled until after the IPO, does Uber even care? Only time will tell.----Radical UrbanistCritic of tech futures and host of Tech Won’t Save Us: https://bit.ly/twsuParis Marx--119Paris MarxinRadical Urbanist--7Paris MarxinRadical Urbanist--133Paris Marx--3Unbecoming--768umair haqueinEudaimonia and Co--56Daniel RizeainEntrepreneur's Handbook--6The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Cory Doctorow--31HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Paris Marx,https://medium.com/@parismarx,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FeuVLcysbjakvqmMv9ZoAQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*IjdjfLa9wUz9AeLPjpD0Sg.jpeg",3,0

190,39033,https://medium.com/@chadcoopercreative/easing-into-motion-be02c1d258e1?source=tag_archive---------100-----------------------,Easing Into Motion,None,"Chad CooperFollow--ListenShareThe speed at which an object travels is a key factor to motion design. Speed graphs, or F-Curves, are how we can adjust the speed of objects between keyframes.Speed equates to easing in motion design.Easing is just one of the key principles of motion design. The stock approaches to easing are ease in, ease out, and easy ease.Motion design is created by using keyframes. Keyframes are how we tell an object where to go in an animation over a period of time. In addition to spatial data, keyframes also store the information related to speed.A speed graph’s form will change depending on the intensity of the easing applied. A more intense, vertical slope means that an object is traveling fast at that point in time. A shallow, flatter slope means an object is moving slowly. If an object has flatlined, it’s no longer moving.Depending on the coordinates affected, an object can have three separate speeds to work with. The planes are X, Y and Z. In order to keep things clear, the examples in this post only affect one axis and don’t make use of the other principles of motion design.LinearLinear animation means that there is no easing applied to an object. We typically try to avoid linear motion. It’s not very interesting and comes across as mechanical, not organic. For the most part, everything in our world has some sort of easing applied to it. Think about a sprinter. A sprinter doesn’t start off the blocks at their top speed, they ease into the speed over the 100m dash. Although linear keyframes can still be useful, in general they’re best to avoid.Ease InMotion that eases in means that an object will slow down as it arrives at the next keyframe. Think about the sprinter again. Only this time, think about the sprinter as they cross the finish line. After crossing the finish line at full speed, a sprinter doesn’t abruptly stop. They gradually slow down until they have come to a rest.Ease OutEasing out means that an object will start slow and gain speed as it leaves a keyframe. A way to think of this is a car at a red light. When the light turns green, the car eases out of being stopped, it doesn’t start at full speed.Easy EaseWith easy ease, there is easing applied to both sides of a keyframe. As an object approaches the next keyframe it will start to slow down. After arriving at the keyframe it will ease back out.A real world example of this is a ball being thrown straight up in the air. As the ball is arriving at its peak, it will begin to decrease in speed. Upon hitting the peak, gravity will bring the ball back down.Make it your ownAll of the previous examples were done using stock After Effects ease settings. In order to harness the power of easing, it’s important to find your own speed settings. The upcoming motion examples were done with custom velocities. We can see how subtle changes in the speed graph drastically change the motion.№5This example has a fast take off and landing. The middle of the motion has a smooth gradual arc to ease the object into being pulled back down.№6Here, the object experiences more of a standstill when it reaches its peak before falling back down.№7This example has the object starting at a fast velocity and then slowly easing into the final keyframe.№8Here, the object slowly eases out of the starting keyframe and then takes off into the last keyframe with an abrupt stop.№9The keyframes in this example have an intense ease in and ease out applied. The object has to drastically increase its speed in-between the two keyframes to properly ease in and out.All motion examples in this post were created by me.----Chad is a Product Designer.

Powershare Foundation — Portfolio--ListenShareThe Computing Revolution.“We cannot accomplish all that we need to do without working together.” — Bill Richardson.On July 14, 1789, a state prison on the east side of Paris, known as the Bastille, was attacked by an angry and aggressive mob. The prison by that time has become a symbol of the absolute monarchy. This attack marked the first and most defining climax of the French Revolution. History is a witness to many of such revolutions instigated and executed by the force of the crowd. And what is a revolution if not a fight for freedom? Sure, its outcome was not always necessarily positive, but the prime idea behind every revolution is — “for the good of the people”.A crowd is generally defined as “a large number of people gathered together in one place, for one cause”, but who said that this gathering must necessarily be physical? What if people virtually connect to each other on some sort of platform to accomplish a task using shared emotions? This is basically how crowdsourcing was born.Today the world is undergoing some unprecedented changes. With political instability, economic turmoil, technological shifts, globalization, and the demands of a new generation of workers, we all see that some radical changes are to be made if we want to sustain our civilization. Every organization, regardless of industry, must continually reassess what it does. This revolution will have profound implications and masses of people are the ones leading it.But what exactly is this new revolution fighting for? I mean, yes, on the basic level it serves the same goal as all others, but still, as every revolution is different by its essence, so is this one. Unlike our ancestors, we have a new power, a power which is so potent and yet so inefficiently used. We use it every day, even now while you’re reading this article you are using it, but only a microscopic portion of its full potential. We’re talking about the processing power. Averagely people only use 1% of their CPU when they use their PCs, laptops, mobiles or any other device. Which means that 99% of that power is just wasted away on nothing.In times of change, opportunities for disruption abound. Using this new power as well as embracing a culture of agility will help ameliorate the risk of disruption for existing businesses and give us new opportunities to prove to be a disruptor in the whole system.Now you might be wondering what the heck is CPU. Basically, not to get into any technical details, it’s the heart and brain of any device, interpreting and executing machine-level instructions, as well as detecting errors. How does the CPU know which instruction to execute? Well, there is a dedicated register in CPU called Program Counter that points to the memory location where next instruction is stored. Instruction is in Main Memory — it is to be transferred to CPU to be executed.Buying and maintaining high-performance computing systems are exceedingly costly affairs, but don’t despair, there is a less costly and more holistic way to get the exact same, or even better, results.Collection of the public computers gives us an economical alternative of high-performance computing systems. What we mean by this is that that even small computers when working together, collaboratively provide huge computation capability that is quite comparable to a supercomputing infrastructure. This is called Crowd Computing, which is narrowly defined as being computer-mediated computing using a huge number of computers behaving as a crowd to accomplish one goal of enhancing the computation. It’s a variation of crowdsourcing.In endeavouring to strengthen the communication and collaboration between machine and human, the term ‘Crowd Computing’ has been used in quite a few diverse contexts. It has been referred to conceptualize in various ways in the form of crowdsourcing, human computation, social computing, cloud computing and mobile computation. Indeed, it represents different connotation in different perspectives.Crowd Computing is, fundamentally, a distributed computing framework where a big non-trivial task is divided into numerous independent atomic tasks that are distributed over multiple computing devices for processing.These atomic tasks are sometimes referred to as micro-tasks which are kept ready in a job pool. Available crowdworker are being searched for and a set of suitable crowdworkers is selected. Each micro-task from the job pool is assigned to a different crowdworker from that set (though sometimes the same task can be given to different crowdworker to maintain reliability). These micro-tasks are given as simple programs to the crowdworker without any contextual information. After execution of these independent micro-tasks, each crowdworker submits the output to the centralized master where all the micro-results are gathered, checked for errors and assembled to get the final result.As defined in “Crowd Computing: The Computing Revolution”, this whole process basically consists of four components:· Requester: Who needs High-performance Computers (HPC)and submit jobs. Typically, it is a server that hosts the crowd project. In large Crowd Computing projects the requester itself maintains the server which hosts the project that intends to leverage Crowd Computing.· Crowdworker: People lend their devices to execute the jobs. These crowd devices are denoted as crowdworkers. The devices may range from a smartphone to desktops. When the devices are found idle, the jobs are processed following the (CPU) cycle-stealing scheme.· Platform: Middleware for job management along with the server and client applications. The server application is responsible for job creation, discovering suitable crowdworker, job assigning and job scheduling to the designated crowdworkers. collecting the results from multiple crowdworkers, assemble them, and updating in the server application and for further purposes. It is responsible for implementing failure recovery schemes in case of failures. The client application installed on a crowd device is responsible for getting the job executed, opportunistically, that is assigned to that particular device and sending the result to the server once it is completed.· Network: The computers are connected to the Internet either directly or through Wi-Fi.As you might have already guessed there are two main approaches of crowd computing, those are:· Desktop Crowd Computing — In this type of computing, computers are usually stationary and connected to the Internet directly· Mobile Crowd Computing — Mobile Crowd Computing comprises mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Nowadays, these devices are getting remarkably powerful and fairly comparable to their non-mobile counterparts like desktops and laptops. Hence, a sufficient number of connected mobile devices may provide a substantial computation capacity.Now, let’s get to characteristics of Crowd Computing:· Collective Effort: The beauty of Crowd Computing lies in the collective effort of numerous small, mid-size and big computers in accomplishing a large computing problem. But the interesting point is that these contributors or the crowdworkers typically are oblivion to each other.· On-Demand Computing: those who require computing resource do not have to buy or own that permanently. They can avail Crowd Computing once required, by submitting their jobs to the available crowdworkers.· Opportunistic: One of the most interesting characteristics of Crowd Computing is its opportunistic nature. This opportunism can be experienced in two different contexts. First, the server continuously searches for the available crowdworkers and opportunistically submits a task whenever a suitable one is found. Second, once the job is submitted to the crowdworker, the client application opportunistically pushes the task to the client CPU whenever is sensed as idle.· Scalable: The Crowd Computing paradigm is highly scalable. The infrastructure supporting Crowd Computing could encompass any number of computers.· Elastic: Thanks to high scalability, the requester can involve as many crowdworkers, if available, as needed. There is no logical nor physical (if the server application supports) limitation for that.· Follows the Client/Server Model: Crowd Computing distinctly follows a client/server model for data computation. The clients do not interact with other clients for sharing and collaborating work. They communicate with only a remote server from which they take command and return the result after execution.· Voluntary Participation: Even though this is not an absolute characteristic for the Crowd Computing in general, the majority of the existing Crowd Computing projects rely on the voluntary participation of the people.· No Human Intervention: Unlike Crowdsourcing, Crowd Computing has no human intervention in the computation process which is performed at the client-end computer. The server takes the burden to split the big computation problem into small tasks like data crunching etc. which are being delivered to the client for further processing.Just like any stick has two endings, Crowd Computing carries some significant benefits and nonetheless important issues with it. Let’s start with good news.As we already said, accumulated CPU cycles from a large number of computers generate a massive processing power that is far more powerful than High-Performance Parallel Computers. Plus is requires absolutely no upfront investment. The cost of fixed computing resources like supercomputing facility or grid computing is totally eliminated in Crowd Computing. Millions and millions of devices voluntarily provide computing service that bears no cost to the project itself. Instead, participants themselves bear costs for willingly donating their CPU resources. Plus, this whole process does not require much maintenance and management either. The only thing you have to take care of is the server and the application software. And last but not least, the favorite perks of environmentalists — it leads to green computing. Why? Because it doesn’t require as much power as centralized high-performance clusters, which means that carbon footprint is considerably lower.Now let’s get to the negative aspect of this endeavor. First and foremost in crowd computing, no one can really control which user enters and leaves the network, or when he does it. Because of this there always is a risk of a job not being finished. Even worse, a job can be finished incorrectly. What we mean by this is, that a crowdworker may ill-intentionally send an unsolicited result to disrupt the crowd project. But don’t worry, there is a way to fix this — adopting redundancy. The same job should be sent to multiple random crowdworkers and then the results must be compared with each other. This way we can reassure the validity of one result by comparing it to several others and as crowdworkers are chosen randomly there is only a theoretical chance that the selected workers have conspired.Now that we somewhat understand the concept of Crowd Computing, let us speak about its practical applications and see if it really is such a big deal.Honestly, almost all the existing Crowd Computing projects are directed to solve certain specific problems and the required infrastructure are maintained by the associated organization or institution. But, if we want to use the Crowd Computing at its full potential, we have to make it accessible to the common people. They will not only be crowdworkers but also requesters and be able to avail this facility when they need. For that, there should be some entity or common platform which will do the job as the facilitator between the crowd requesters and the crowdworkers by providing Crowd Computing as a Service (CCaaS), very similar to IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) in cloud computing. The requester who needed extra computing facility will request to the Crowd Computing service provider. In turn, the service provider will arrange the crowdworkers and distribute the job to them. After finishing, the service provider will send the result back to the requester. One legitimate question may arise — why Crowd Computing when cloud computing is already popular and widely accessible and can easily cater to the need? The answer is simple — cost-effectiveness.Rather than be drowned by the feeling of impending doom, however, organizations should look to Crowd Computing and new approaches for research and development, in order to remain competitive, increase efficiency, and generate new business. And all organizations need to consider how the Crowd Computing impacts their industry.Worldwide there is a growing interest among people in “sharing” model of business such as renting out one’s car, apartment, bike or even the Wi-Fi network when we don’t need it. In quest of greater efficiency, this sharing economy has now pervaded into the computing world as well. Various reports on data center study have revealed that 80–90% of the capacity of data center servers remain unutilized and therefore, the firms are fast joining the cloud computing bandwagon, which aims to maximize the utilization of computing resources. A similar trend is seen in consumer technology space as well where the high capacity and smart computing devices (desktop, laptop, and mobile phones) are flooded in the market but only a fraction of its capacity is put to real use. These smart devices with high-end processors can be better leveraged through sharing mechanism to create larger welfare of a community of interest. A closed network of organizations may leverage these distributed devices to solve the complex computational tasks and in turn compensate the owners of these devices for the period of usage. When this network expands to include the larger group of people with converging interest, a much larger computing resource pool is available on tap which reduces the cost of computing significantly. When the cost of creating an information base significantly lowered by utilizing the idle capacities of hundreds and thousands of high-end computing devices, the pricing of the product based on this information will also be low which in turn, will increase the demand for the product.In the field of science and mathematics like physics, astronomy, chemistry and molecular biology there are numerous unsolved theories and concepts. Many assumptions proposed need to be validated for future discovery. Reasoning these demands simulating models and processing huge data and instructions. Some of these tasks are very resource consuming and require supercomputer infrastructures. Lack of resources is one of the hurdles in these futuristic researches. The voluntary participation of computers around the world sharing their CPU cycles and memory gives enormous computing strength to scientists and researchers to sort out the issue.In IoT-based applications, different electronic devices are connected to share data giving a sense of automation. The application of IoT could be found in homes, offices, production houses, logistics, shopping zones etc. IoT interacts with the user, understands their needs, schedule, working behavior and other patterns.These require continuous data processing and running AI programs to comprehend the data. This requires fair computing power. Small-scale Crowd Computing could be able to distribute the workload among the computing devices available in the house. For example, in smart home-based IoT application, the computing workload can be distributed among the smart mobile devices and other tablets and laptop available in the house. Thus, eliminating the need for huge computational resources and associated cost.A more effective way to utilize the CPU of consumer appliances was presented by Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) in the early 2000’s. “BOINC is a software system that makes it easy for scientists to create and operate public-resource computing projects” (Anderson, 2004). In their research paper, public-resource computing is seen as an alternative to maintaining supercomputer centers and dedicated machine rooms, which dramatically reduces the set-up and processing costs for scientific research. Moreover, the potential of consumer hardware in terms of floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s) is significantly higher than that of hashes per second (h/s). The major challenge for BOINC projects is to adequately reward backers, in order to increase their incentives for the community as well as improve ease of user interaction — overall. As of March 22, 2019 BOINC was able to extract 28,018.571 teraFLOP/s from the global IPP, which is relatively the same power as world’s 9th biggest supercomputer (Titan) has (Mordor Intelligence, 2017).World Community Grid — a project coordinated by IBM, was launched in November 2004 and “enables anyone with a computer, smartphone or tablet to donate their unused computing power to advance cutting-edge scientific research on topics related to health, poverty and sustainability” (World Community Grid, 2014). World Community Grid has 46,003 active users contributing 757,961 TeraFLOP/s as of March 22, even though WCG software is available on Windows, IOS, LINUX, Android the project still utilizes a trivial portion of the market potential (Boincstats, 2004). One of the probable reasons for low efficiency is mediocre incentive structure and ease of access, as all BOINC projects require the supporters to install the software. “Gridcoin is a blockchain-based distributed computing network powered by the idle processing potential of existing hardware.” According to the whitepaper, Gridcoin targets the IoT industry, as any device housing a processor can be part of the network (Gridcoin Whitepaper, 2017). As of March 22, 2019, Gridcoin is one of the largest contributing team to BOINC, with 4,171 active users (Boincstats, 2004). The incentives of Gridcoin community is proportional to the provided processing power of the supporters. However, Gridcoin token price has dropped by 97.3% from the peak price of 18.8 cents on January 7, 2018, and equals 0.00482279$ at the moment of writing (Coinmarketcap). These numbers lead to a conclusion that the major motivators of Gridcoin’s existing users are the social and emotional benefits rather than monetary.At this very moment, BOINC has 4,475,025 users, 853427 hosts and 108,151 teams.This distributed computing infrastructure follows a client/server architecture. Client machines registered to various projects are controlled and coordinated by BOINC servers. As servers are distributed in multiple machines, practically it can support projects of any size. The server splits a task into micro-tasks and sends them to associated clients. The required processing is performed by the clients and the computational results are uploaded to the server for further validation. The intercommunication between the client and server takes place by Remote Procedure Call (RPC). The client can register to multiple projects whereby the computation of each project running on the CPU is independent of each other (BOINC client/server technology). BOINC suitably carries out projects for simulating the physical system, genetic algorithm, and analyzing a large amount of data.Crowdsourcing and human computation are useful in a number of real-world applications but only if crowdworkers are supplied with enough motivation. Crowds generate large data sets useful for natural language process and computer vision; they work together to formulate intelligent responses far beyond what we can automate, and they power intelligent interactive systems currently impossible with automated approaches alone. It’s a wonderful means to achieve high-performance computations economically. Crowd Computing has potential in solving enormous challenges of different fields such as science, medical & health, weather prediction, disaster management etc. It also offers significant economic value if properly exercised by businesses. Crowd Computing can cherish the similar success as cloud computing if it is also offered as a service so that anyone who needs computational power for a project can avail the facility whenever required at no or negligible cost.----JSC.

In functional testing, we tend to cover all the actions and scenarios which user of the system can perform. In this approach, we focus mainly on two perspectives 1. Requirement based testing, 2.Business process-based testing. When it comes to the functional testing of API or web services then it becomes some different skill set and tools. For addressing this relatively new domain there are many tools and frameworks available in the market some of them are paid and some of them are open source and free to use.What is REST Assured?REST Assured is simple java library which is used to test REST services and create an automated script. It can be used for regression testing of REST services or one can use it for smoke testing, sanity testing depends on requirement. REST Assured is developed by JayWay company. This library can be used along with JUnit or TestNG testing framework to enhance test case maintainability and reporting.Why REST Assured?There are many reasons for choosing REST Assured for testing REST services. With all the below features one can handle automated REST API testing much easier.Who should use REST Assured:-REST Assured provides gherkin type syntax, individual(QA professional) will love if he is a BDD(Behaviour Driven Development) lover. As REST Assured is free to use and is based on Java, so it becomes the perfect candidate for used as REST API testing. As it is based on Java so one can get help from the huge Java community.How to make POST Request with REST Assured:-Example:-2. Now create a java class and then annotate the test method with @Test annotation than use following basic syntax structure to make GET request:-Conclusion:- As we know API/Web Services are gaining popularity in the current development scenario. There are many free and paid tools available for API testing but when it comes to the flexibility and rich support of the various readily available feature then RestAssured is surely a good choice. It has all the useful library and feature which enhances the API functional testing.References:- http://rest-assured.io, https://stackoverflow.com,----Group of smart Engineers with a Product mindset who partner with your business to drive competitive advantage | www.knoldus.comKnoldus Inc.--1Knoldus Inc.inKnoldus - Technical Insights--2Knoldus Inc.--Knoldus Inc.--Nick Kudrow--2Suraj MishrainLevel Up Coding--1Arslan AhmadinLevel Up Coding--6Hussein Nasser--37Jacob BennettinLevel Up Coding--51The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Knoldus Inc.,https://medium.com/@knoldus,2,3,3

And it incorporates reliable material and viewpoints.When we organize an event, it is essential to make a difference. We must contribute more than our competitors. In fact, it is necessary to print a distinctive stamp to our way of working. Being pioneers in betting on a certain methodology is key to achieve it; that is why we are always in pursuit of new trends. Because of this, it is easy for us to wonder if the RV will be a revolution for the events sector. Finding the answer can be vital to becoming leaders in the sector. Before doing so, let’s see how it has been applied successfully to tell a story.The virtual journalismJournalists increasingly use VR to reach the heart of the reader. It is not necessary that it is a story with a happy ending: virtual reality can be useful for telling stories of great harshness. It is an effective way to put ourselves in the shoes of those who star in the news, as it appeals to our emotions and feelings.Any event can be contemplated from different prisms. In the case of the press, we usually do it from the point of view of the journalist who tells us the news. However, virtual reality goes a step further: it gives us the opportunity to be part of history and to know how its protagonists have lived it. We will see the news through your eyes.A great example of this “new journalism” has been given to us by a prestigious British newspaper. We refer to The Guardian, which has created the “6 × 9” campaign, a virtual experience of isolation. Through an application based on the testimonies of some inmates, one can experience the experience of being confined in a cell of 2 × 3 meters, 6 × 9 feet. Many convicted spend 23 hours a day in that minimal space.It is so hard that, without counting the death penalty, it represents the worst punishment that can be inflicted on an inmate. It is true that it is often used with those who show the most violent behavior inside prison, but there are many voices that denounce this type of practices.For example, organizations in defense of human rights comment that sometimes prisoners end up in these cells that are neither so violent nor so dangerous. And they see this discipline unnecessary even for the most serious cases. The objective of the campaign is that these punishments be dismissed or at least reserved for very specific occasions.With the Guardian app, the news becomes a real experience for those who try it and achieve the marked goal: to move the viewer. In doing so, he manages to position himself against these practices, a feeling that leads many to act to fight against what they consider an injustice. Without a doubt, it is a journalistic success.At this point, a question arises: can virtual reality be so effective to organize an event as to tell a story? It is undeniable that with it you can get the attendees are protagonists of the event, live it in a way that captivates and enjoy the appointment with fullness.Is the RV valid for any event?In February of this year, the Mobile World Congress was held in Barcelona. One of the images that attracted the most attention was that of Mark Zuckerberg giving a lecture for an audience in which everyone wore RV glasses. Despite the surprise, it seems reasonable that the creator of Facebook uses the latest technology available for the staging of his conference.However, virtual reality can be useful for any kind of event. We can ensure that more and more will be used in events that have nothing to do with technology. It is a way to lower costs: with it, we can transmit sensations and live experiences that if they were real would suppose a much higher economic outlay.Virtual reality will revolutionize the organization of eventsAccording to the above, we can conclude that the RV will be a real revolution for the events sector. The truth is that it is already starting to be. Through it, the attention of the attendees is captured, and the experience leaves an indelible mark on his memory.Using this tool, which mixes reality and fiction, the audience is not a mere spectator. Virtual reality turns everyone present into the protagonists of the event to which they have been invited. The product, information or services will be more real thanks to this technology. Attendees will immerse themselves in a virtual world in which they will know first-hand the essence of the event. It is essential that the professionals of the sector know the RV and begin to apply it so as not to be left behind. Make no mistake: virtual reality will soon be the queen of all events.APPZ PLANET3719 Boone Crockett Lane, Portland, WA 97218360–488–4497info@appzplanet.org----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Christina SainUX Planet--64Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Vikalp KaushikinUX Planet--35Michal Malewicz--24HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Kirk Manzo,https://medium.com/@appzplanetinfo,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8gIzmsAPDQbgLF_jJC07kA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*43zOKkTuxB3NI1LNBLavEg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*_6lUWoU2X358At-5fdgusg.jpeg",4,0

The framework cites the harmful effects of global warming as outlined by the UN’s Special Report on Global Warming. The bombshell report revealed that climate warming over the past century is largely due to human activity and found that gone unchecked, would cost trillions of dollars, displace millions of people from coastal regions, and lead to massive losses in biodiversity. Initially a “loose set of goals”, the deal’s key provisions have been clearly defined.The Green New Deal aims to meet the United States’ demand for electricity through “clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources” by “dramatically expanding and upgrading existing renewable power sources and deploying new capacity.” The plan, says MIT Technology Review, adopts a “technology-agnostic approach,” leaving much room for interpretation and innovation, though natural methods and renewable energy are preferred. But it is urgent, calling on the United States to meet these goals by 2030.Electricity, in particular, is a big issue in America. Electricity is largely produced by burning fossil fuels to drive heat engines. But traditional fuels like oil and gas are harmful to the environment and are facing depletion. In accordance with the Green New Deal, the US must look to viable alternative like nuclear fission, wind, and solar power.Though Ocasio-Cortez herself discouraged the construction of new nuclear plants, nuclear fission is an extremely powerful energy source that can help curb emissions. Nuclear reactors split atoms, traditionally uranium, and use the resulting heat to drive steam turbines. While nuclear power is clean, it is far from renewable. This is because the materials needed to power nuclear fission, like uranium, are limited. Moreover, the mining and disposal processes are extremely harmful to the Earth, though innovative solutions have begun to address these issues.Solar energy is a powerful tool, that if harnessed efficiently, can meet America’s ever-growing demand for electricity. Every day, the Earth receives enough sunlight to power the entire world’s energy needs for 30 years. There are two major solar power solutions: photovoltaic cells and concentrated solar power. Photovoltaic cells (PV) capture sunlight in semiconductor devices, creating electricity. One drawback of PV is that some light is either too weak to generate electricity or generates heat energy. PV power production is also limited to daylight hours. Concentrated solar power, or CSP, collects heat energy from the sun and uses it to power steam turbines that generate electricity. Because the thermal energy from the sun can be stored, CSP is not limited by when the sun is shining; it can be a 24/7 energy source.Energy storage seems to be the best way to meet the electricity demands of the US. Storage options include lithium-ion batteries and thermal energy storage (TES) from CSP. According to Research Interface, lithium-ion batteries can dispatch and store energy quickly and in bulk. They can also be paired with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. However, lithium-ion batteries are extremely costly and have limited lifespans. The price of lithium doubled between 2016 and 2018; mining the material has other costs as well. For example, in South America’s “Lithium Triangle”, it takes almost 500,000 gallons of water to mine one ton of lithium. In Tibet, toxic chemicals from lithium mining poisoned the water supply. Moreover, lithium mining can cause both soil and air pollution. Therefore, lithium-ion batteries are far from a good solution to the world’s energy problem.Thermal energy storage (TES) through molten salt is a more sustainable solution that requires attention and investment. Two companies utilizing CSP and TES technologies are Google X’s Malta and New York-based startup WeSolar CSP. Malta’s system can store energy for more than six hours, and can be converted to electricity at any time. WeSolar CSP’s system uses molten salt as a filler material, and utilizes proprietary software to manage its CSP fields.CSP systems can be applied to water desalination, which will become increasingly important as humans exhaust the Earth’s freshwater resources. Water desalination is an extremely energy-intensive process if done through traditional methods such as reverse osmosis, in which water is forced through a membrane at high pressure to separate the salt. Solar thermal desalination creates a desalination by distillation process. This not only lowers the costs associated with capturing and storing thermal energy, but also makes the thermal desalination process more efficient.Underutilized today, solar power seems to be the ideal solution to meet the goals outlined in Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. But this legislation faces a steep uphill battle in today’s political climate. Market forces must be harnessed to accelerate the adoption of these low-carbon-footprint solutions.One effort in this direction is the revenue-neutral plan now being considered by Congress, the Energy Innovation and Climate Dividend Act. The bill would put a price on carbon and incentivize the development of renewable energy technology. The bill is cosponsored by Democrats and Republicans and is a beacon of hope for environmental preservation and prosperity for our children and the generations beyond. To combat the increasingly negative effects of climate change, America must invest in renewable energy sources. Such an investment would not only secure the quality of life for future generations, but also combat inequalities US citizens face today.----WeSolar CSPWe bring clean energy to life.WeSolar CSP--WeSolar CSPinWeSolar CSP--WeSolar CSP--WeSolar CSP--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423umair haqueinEudaimonia and Co--56HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",WeSolar CSP,https://medium.com/@wesolarcsp,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*eOhbBwlWEFY6nxv4M2sIcw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3cjseiOJDAX55e-Fnc7xNQ.jpeg",4,1

To me, it means that every person has an equivalent vote no matter their socio-economics and that it doesn’t apply to entities like corporations. But the reality is people are fighting against democracy in different degrees because of the fear of loss of their wealth, power and status.For the majority of my life, I didn’t care about politics because I didn’t feel my small voice or vote wouldn’t have any sort of impact. This still holds true to a significant percentage of American’s who don’t engage, as it requires effort to understand how the “democratic” systems work, how these systems are flawed, and what we can do to change them for the better.Later analysis by the University of California, Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project found that there were 235,248,000 people of voting age in the United States in the 2012 election, resulting in 2012 voting age population (VAP) turnout of 54.9%. — WikipediaSince 1964, the U.S. Census Bureau has fielded the Voting and Registration Supplement to the Current Population Survey every two years. — United States Census BureauThe more I have learned the more apparent the democratic suppression and inaccessibility is intended and stems from the origins of the creation of the United States of America, from slavery to women’s rights. The systems were created to limit certain people’s rights.While partisans argue and score political points, members of the Exhausted Majority are so frustrated with the bitter polarization of our politics that many have checked out completely, ceding the floor to more strident voices. — Hidden TribesWith the advent of the internet so much has changed and it has given us a great opportunity to reach more people. But those who fear to lose their wealth and power are using the internet too, to maintain and grow their privilege.This is where organizations like Progressive Coders Network help create a more level playing field for us, average individuals who wish to engage but know it’s very difficult to challenge people who have great wealth and power and don’t wish to share it to better society.Progressive Coders Network is a 501(c)(4) non-partisan progressive community of tech and non-tech activists building open-source tools to empower the grassroots and reduce the influence of big money in politics.Interested in donating today?

Now, with all that being said, let’s dig in. (See Fig. 1)There are typically three things that I can do “quickly” to see how accessible a site is.Here are some of the nifty 👍🏽 web accessibility features Progressive Coders is doing on their homepage:👍🏽When tabbing through links and “buttons” there are blue visual cues (border outlines) set giving links a highlight for better visibility. (Fig. 2)👍🏽 The dark grey #333333 text on light backgrounds such as the blue #AAE8FF has great contrast for better visibility and readability. (Fig. 3)Now here are some small and easy fixes 🛠 I’d recommend to make the site even more accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities:The links:⚠️ The ability to skip the navigation is missing (Fig. 4)✅ Recommendation: Adding a visually hidden link offscreen to give people the ability to skip the navigation if they wish to so they don’t have to navigate through it every time. Here are two things to do to accomplish this first thing and the second thing.⚠️ When keyboarding, a blue visual cue (border outline) appears for the blue #00B0FF buttons with white text #FFFFFF but the buttons disappear. (Fig. 5)✅ Recommendation: Add some CSS to make the links hover state remain when the focus is set to it. Here is a CodePen example of how to do this.⚠️ The Slack & GitHub logo icon links are missing discernible text making it unclear as to what the link is for when using assistive technology. (See Fig. 6)✅ Recommendation: Adding text that is positioned offscreen therefore making it not visible but readable by assistive technologies. Here is a CodePen Example of this. But note that if there is also an image with alt text saying something such as “Slack link” it will cause a stutter. Therefore I would make the image’s alt =“#” which makes it decorative and not read to people.⚠️ The calendars are not accessible via keyboarding. (See Fig. 7)✅ Recommendation: Using semantic HTML to create the calendar instead using <divs> for most all code would make it accessible.Color Contrast:⚠️The blue #00B0FF buttons with white text #FFFFFF need a lot more contrast. (See Fig. 8)✅ Recommendation: Making text darker or blue darker (Text is considered large at 14pt bold or 18pt regular). Here is an example of a black text that would work.⚠️The calendar event times that are grey #4D4D4D with an opacity of 0.75 on white #FFFFFF need more contrast (See Fig. 10)✅ Recommendation: Making text darker or larger (Text is considered large at 14pt bold or 18pt regular). Here is an example of a darker red that would work.⚠️The light blue #337AB7 text on top of the large Prog Code watermark logo has a lot of visual noise creating contrast variations (See Fig. 11)✅ Recommendation: Remove the large watermark logo to start. Add bullet points to the articles to make it easier to visually understand the content.The Images:⚠️ The logomark has no alt text which will force assistive technologies to read the image name in full to people. (See Fig. 12)✅ Recommendation: Since there is readable text after the logo mark image that says the name of the organization I would make the logo mark a decorative image by adding alt=“#” which will keep image from appearing as content.⚠️ There are many images on the homepage that do not have alt text. Unfortunately, this makes the images inaccessible to people as there are no descriptions to be read aloud. (See Fig. 13)✅ Recommendation: Add descriptive alternative text in the code for each image that is important for people to know about. Unless images are just decorative in that case alt=“#” which will keep the image from appearing as content.⚠️ The Slack logo links are missing alt text for the images which will force assistive technologies to read the image name in full to people. (See Fig. 14)✅ Recommendation: As I mentioned above if there is a link that has text and an image that also has alt text it will create a stutter/repetition. Therefore only one is necessary. So, Add descriptive alternative text in the code for each image. Unless images are just decorative in that case alt=“#” which will keep the image from appearing as content.I hope this post will help you, developers, designers, and product managers–to better understand how you can build fully accessible digital products and experiences.

It is said to be a product because this currency is manifested in the form of coins or digital tokens that are widely traded through the internet network. This trade in coins or digital tokens was first initiated by the Bitcoin platform. However, this platform then applies a mining system to get coins in new or original conditions. Along with the passage of time, the development of cryptocurrency began to be felt increasingly widespread and began to try their luck to dominate the trading market. This effort can be seen from the existence of a number of parties who imposed a payment system on offline purchases using digital currencies.Not only that, the market for trading of digital coins and tokens continues to increase in number each year followed by an increase in the number of buyers and users. This is driven by an interesting fact that cryptocurrency does not have a special party responsible for it. At first glance this might seem to be a hindrance because the absence of responsible parties makes it doubtful by some parties about who actually manages the digital financial system. What is meant here is that the transaction system using digital currencies is not controlled by a centralized or centralized system, but is run by blockchain technology which makes the system decentralized.A decentralized system makes every component contained in it not only able to be controlled by one party, but requires a number of other parties that are interconnected and work together in terms of securing the network. This role is carried out by nodes involved in the blockchain technology network as network managers so that they are always available at all times to carry out transactions. Blockchain technology has its own ability to manage network security by relying on encryption systems related to cryptography. This makes this technology superior in terms of security systems compared to security systems commonly used by other financial institutions. Therefore, it is not surprising that this technology is the choice of many cryptocurrency-producing digital platforms.The development continues to be able to be integrated with various functions. If at first, the blockchain makes cryptocurrency only be used to simply run buying and selling transactions or exchanged with other types of digital currency, now cryptocurrency can already perform other functions such as serving land buying, product spending, social media, content creation, health services, and as a reward in the game. For the last function, its use has been very frequent and spread very widely. There are so many types of game applications that guarantee prizes in the form of coins or digital tokens. In general, this type of game is played online and connected with other internet users from various countries.The obstacle experienced by game players is that they are often deceived and do not get a number of coins or promised tokens after winning the game. This is experienced by some people who often fail to obtain digital assets in the games they play. Losses are caused mainly for players who have to make payment transactions to be able to enter the game arena. No party is responsible for this. this is the disadvantage of the digital world where no party directly has a relationship in terms of the economy that are face to face. Digital systems remain digital systems that only run through an internet connection and do not bring together interacting parties.To restore a conducive playing atmosphere, a platform called Dabanking provides services specifically intended to provide entertainment content in the form of game applications. This platform will guarantee that every game played by users has the appropriate rewards for the winners. These rewards can be achieved directly by those who win without worrying about the vagueness of the gift giving system. By supporting a protection system from blockchain technology, Dabanking was built to gather user trust by supporting the concept of system transparency. Every procedure that must be passed will be applied fairly to all people who want to enjoy the playing experience with guaranteed unquestioned benefits.Dabanking relies on the development of Dapps or decentralized applications which are currently the most developed types of applications by technology experts. This application can be accessed through the Dabanking platform so that each game application can be run by participating in operating blockchain technology at the same time. This makes every game lover more comfortable to enjoy the game with guaranteed DAB token prizes officially.Thank you for reading my article for more information please click the link below:Website: https://dabanking.io/homeTwitter: https://twitter.com/Dabanking_ioWhite paper: https://fomo.dabanking.io/static/whitepaper.pdf— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —My Bitcointalk ID: ImanmudaMy Bitcointalk URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2538358;sa=summaryMy ETH: 0x592C3c1E55cea51529221F5f32b287c31a8a0bCB#Dapps #DABANKING #FomoJackpot #Blockchain #ETH----Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Alex Mathers--227Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Iman muda,https://medium.com/@imanmuda566,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*W_B4YVGfSjC5BRq4GPC46A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*yFAp6BFkzw2NjzCskeHzmg.png",4,0

Software developers use it all the time. We can not spend a day without interacting with Git. We can run Git from the terminal or use some third party tools like Sourcetree.But there are some terminal fans who always love to run Git from the terminal only. So for them, it is sometimes difficult to remember and write those long commands. Ohh no buddy!! It is very much a boring and time-consuming task to write long commands all the time 😭😭😭.So what should we do now??🤔Okay, we should start looking for a shortcut for those long long commands.🏃‍🏃‍🏃‍Look what we found: Git Alias. It has come as the rescuer for all.We all likely know what an alias is — it means a false name or nickname.So using git alias, we can assign a nickname to a long git command. This is perfect. 😍Now let’s try to find a place where we can write these nicknames.Searching 🔍 Searching 🔍Searching 🔍…Yes, bash_profile is the place where we can write them.From Terminal, we can easily open bash_profile by using the following command:Now enter into insert mode in your vim editor by tapping i from the keyboard.✓The first program we use to write in any programming language is a Hello World program. Let’s not break this tradition — we are going to write our very first alias with a simple hello command.Open bash_profile, and write the following line:It says that we have created an alias named hello and assigns the right-hand side as the command to execute. So whenever we write hello in the terminal, it should execute the command assigned to it.Save the changes and reload the bash_profile by using the following command:Now if we type hello in the terminal, it prints Hello Boudhayan!! How are you?Awesome!! 😎😎😎So we have learned how to create an alias command in bash_profile.If we look closely, then we can relate to it. We can find some similarities with the variable declaration in any language. Yes, we already know about that, right?Now let’s create some git aliases to make our daily life easier and faster.🤘We use this command for cloning a remote repository to a local system.Though it’s a short command, we want to start learning git aliases by making it even shorter.🤷‍Just like above, open bash_profile, write the below line and reload bash_profile. See the magic.☄️So from now on, for cloning a repository, we do not need to write this:instead, we will use the below command for cloning purposes:Boom!! Your remote repository is successfully cloned into your local system.👊👊👊We push our local commits to the development or master branch by using the below commands:Now, we can write shorter version like below:So from now, we will use gpd and gpm to push local commits to the development and master branch respectively.🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻 Hurrah!! We have made it.🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻I have created some more git aliases which can be really useful in our programming life. Check them out:We can also use the shell function to declare more complex git aliases. But to start with this, we need to know how to write a shell function.🧐It is very easy to write a shell function which is like a normal C function.👍Now let’s try this. This function will create a directory in the current path and then immediately move into that directory. We know the below commands already to make it happen:We can compress those two commands by creating a simple function in bash_profile like below:Now reload the bash_profile source once and run the following:It will create a directory named test in the current path and move to that directory. Cool!!😎To push the code in the remote branch, we need to make a commit with some message. Only then we can push to a branch. So basically this is a combination of two commands (commit and push). But we want to try the same with a single one-line command by writing a shell function for this. 👆We can easily do this by writing a simple shell function. Open bash_profile and write the following the function:Reload the bash_profile once and use the command like below:Cool!! From now we can use this gcp command to commit and push in one shot.😎In a development or feature branch, all the team members push their changes almost every day. So sometimes it is very difficult to find a particular commit among all the commits.To easily handle this type of situation, we can write a function which will search the commit logs for a particular message and return the commit.To do this, we will write a function like below:Occasionally if we want to search for a commit by the commit message, then we can do it by using gfc:So we have learned how to use shortcuts for git commands.May these aliases and functions save you from writing those long git commands and make your life easy and smooth. You can add your own aliases, functions and make modifications to them — no one’s permission is required except bash.😉😉😉🙏🙏🙏 Cheers!!!

The words “crypto,” “blockchain,” and “bitcoin,” have made their way into countless headlines, blogs, and even government offices. For better or worse, the mention of “blockchain technology” draws in the eyes of curious readers.Skeptics and die-hard crypto-believers alike want to stay updated to the latest news article that reinforces their side of the argument. A story about the latest ICO scandal, a new partnership between a token and a bank, or a new statement on government regulation will get traction. Once the reader is caught up in this world (and most likely has ‘some skin in the game’), they will be curious, even eager, to know more. However, the truth is few people actually understand what a blockchain does, let alone understand its true potential. They’d much rather hear fairy tales of the token that will pump their investment to 100x. “When moon?” Whatever the reason may be, people are interested. This new technology IS changing the world. One, rather specific, example of the change it’s bringing is in the compact supercomputer we have in our pockets at any given time.Smartphones. These have become an extension of our beings. In them, we have our memories recorded in the form of pictures, messages, and apps. Without them, our existence would feel incomplete, disconnected. Relying so much on a single device creates a massive risk. Too often, valuable pictures, messages, or files are lost forever because someone was fidgeting with their phone on the toilet or near a pool. Even waterproof phones can’t avoid this. They may still be damaged beyond repair.This problem only hurts the consumer. Retailers obviously have no problem with this as it forces the individual to purchase a new phone. We, the consumers, are then left to begin again from square one. A popular means to avoid this issue is uploading a backup of the information onto a computer or a cloud, much like Google Drive or Dropbox. However, uploading the information to a cloud makes it vulnerable to attacks, as you’re literally putting your “digital life” in this company’s “digital hands.” As previous attacks and leaks have shown us, clouds, phones, and computers can be hacked. How then, could we back up our information while retaining a solid security protocol that we can trust?You guessed it, with the help of a blockchain!A blockchain system requires distributed nodes, an undecipherable fragmenting of the information, and a private encryption key that only the individual user knows. Put simply, every user participates as a node on the chain, contributing their phone’s idle memory and network access. Their information is uploaded to the cloud in fragments that are undecipherable and spread among multiple devices. Thus, no entire document is ever on any one device. The entire system is virtually unhackable, as the only way to access your private documents is through your own unique private key. No computer in the world is powerful enough to put that ‘jigsaw puzzle’ back together without it. The best part of it all is that you can use this system to automatically back up the entirety of your phone’s contents onto this cloud. By uploading it, you can never lose it. Even if the phone itself is destroyed beyond repair and broken back into its original atomic particles, or tossed in a fire (we’re really not sure what hazards your job may entail). You can simply buy a new phone that connects to that same blockchain, input your private key, and voila! Everything is back to the palm of your hand, where it belongs.The alternative is a painful and timely process. To begin re-downloading all of the same apps, to remember all the old passwords, and to cry about the memory of what great pictures you took on your last vacation… it’s tough. Blockchain helps ease that pain by preventing it altogether. The device you hold in your hands becomes nothing more than a window through which you access your data, your life.That’s not even the most amazing part. The best part is that this solution is already here!Several companies are already tackling this exact scenario. Four major companies have taken on the task of creating the world’s most reliable phone by simply creating a system that works beyond the phone itself. Sirin Labs, TiEN Mobile, HTC, and Pundi-X are the leading innovators of this new niche market. They are the pioneers that are paving the way towards this new era of smartphones, creating their own secure blockchain-backed phones. As with any pioneering technology, these new phones don’t yet have all of the same features we’re used to. It takes billions, if not trillions, of dollars and decades of research and development to achieve the level of phones we’ve come to take for granted. Whenever a new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) joins the race, their product has the potential to change the tech space, and in many cases the world. But it does require time, and a loyal user base to help test the product.Apple created phones without keyboards and buttons and the rest of the world quickly followed suit. It was innovation, excitement, and competition that pushed phones to become the way they are today. The same can be said about the space race in the ‘60s. Now, the third lap of the ‘phone race’ has already begun. As such, the future is no longer focused on convenience. The focus now is on the security and preservation of that convenience. A great part of our lives is on our phones, now: credit card information, digital assets, sensitive files, and personal pictures. They all rest in that same tiny super-computer. The focus of the future is in making sure we never have to worry about the security of our information, nor that of our own privacy.Blockchain-backed phones are the solution to that privacy assurance. With them, we can lead the way for innovation towards fully-secured phones. The sad truth is that security and privacy are a luxury these days, rather than the norm. Blockchain implementation can help with this problem and, similarly, in many other facets of our daily living. Paired with the help of smart contracts, oracles, AI learning systems, and the ever-developing wisdom of the communities fueling it; bigger changes are yet to come. It’s good to stay informed and be a part of this innovation, of change. So, when you think about everything you do through your personal smartphone, are you sure it’s safe enough?----Futurist and advocate of time travelWilliam Tien--William Tien--3William Tien--William Tien--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",William Tien,https://medium.com/@belloc,1,5,50

We live in a society where people have a spectrum of viewpoints but there is always an audience ready to shame them on social media for being at the odds with the majority due to which all of us are forced to walk on eggshells. We often forget that we live in a civil society that encourages viewpoint diversity, civil disagreements and most importantly tells us that not everything is binary in nature.In this hyper-connected world, even a flash of offence leads to people getting labeled and stereotyped. Labelling and shaming people will always discourage them to be receptive towards feedback and would make them less interested in engaging with people across lines of difference. As a society, we have been habitually assuming the worst about the people by reading their actions in the most uncharitable way possible. These assumptions lead to despairs, anxiety and a network of damaged relationships. We are master at misdiagnosing our feelings which are compelling in nature but not reliable. They distort our reality, deprive us of insights and damage relationships. We are losing the feeling of what it feels like discovering a fellow human being because the growth of technology has made things more certain and less interested.As technology advances, we will become obsolete and lose the fun of exploring things. The time has come to regulate our media consumption because, at the time crisis, your blood and flesh friends will come to your rescue, not the ones on the internet.----Founder at CLOwork.

212,20580,https://medium.com/nomadic-labs/from-random-hacks-to-the-future-of-kindness-c7c774b4836f?source=tag_archive---------105-----------------------,From Random Hacks to the Future of Kindness,"RHoK #10 - April 26-27-28, 2019 | Random Hacks of Kindness","Luisa JiFollowNomadic Labs--ListenShareLast year I had a conversation with Brett Tackaberry, who founded and co-organizes Ottawa’s Random Hacks of Kindness, over my #impact30coffee challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed his knowledge spanning many fields covering business, design, and technology, and of course, his views on emerging business models and how the tech sector can open up new ways of giving back to society. We ended the conversation at the “future of kindness” and that it lies in our human nature of wanting to make people around us feel safe, secure, and ultimately: happy.Over the weekend of April 26–28, 2019, at another sold out and successful Random Hacks of Kindness, I caught up with Brett again at the hackathon to find out what he discovered over the past year within the RHoK community and where his thoughts carry the movement to continue connecting talents and resources with great social good organizations.Photos: Brandon Brule, Jason Fournier and Suvro(@bitsknit)Last time we sat down and talked about social impact and Random Hacks of Kindness was around the same time in 2018. I was here in October with Sharon and we had so much fun working with Vélo Vanier. Over the year, what are some new insights you have discovered or things you’ve been working on?BT: So, the event structure of Random Hacks hasn’t changed that much. It’s still is a number of organizations around the city and a bunch of developers and designers getting together. My understanding of it has changed a little bit in the past year. Participants are really easy to find. I’ll do a few tweets out and a couple of newsletters out, they get retweeted and then people show up.It sells out a few weeks in advance, and if I put any sort of pressure on it, it will just sell out quicker. There’s no lack of enthusiasm or desire to give back. I sense that people have a lot of good will, a lot of expertise, a lot of time to give and they are looking for outlets to give back.I see a lot of support. I don’t get a lot of money thrown at me but it’s really easy to find sponsorship and depending on when people’s budget come and go, I can tell by how well the companies or the markets are doing because that affects how much people can give. I’ve really only had to reach out to fairly close colleagues and friends to get enough money to run these things, so the money behind it is actually pretty easy to find too. I haven’t had to do anything crazy: no grants; no government funding; and, I don’t have to do any real call for sponsorship.I go to friends, and that’s been pretty good. I think in terms of the supports, they are often from the people or the companies.I always find it difficult to find participating organizations. I always shopped it out to those who have a good network in the not for profit area or the social enterprise space. So, over the last couple of years and more so the last year I started getting a better understanding of the challenges on how to find projects but also building networks. Even after having the network, it is still hard to get the projects into Random Hacks.Now you’d think that people would have all these problems just ready to go, but they don’t. You know, when you think that “this is broken, that’s broken, and this thing… it could be better” there are a few things at play: more and more we realize that we can’t just go fixing people’s problems despite being a solutions-oriented society. We still can’t just go and trying to solve everything, right? It is being able to bring people along, identify their problems, and understand their problems. Be willing to champion them to own the problems and adopt technology to solve these things. That’s been a barrier.The organizations that are being left behind are organizations that don’t have money as their primary business driver. They are not in it to make money, they are in it to feed people, keep people happy, to help improve literacy and so on. They do need to raise money, but they are not in it for that. Again, we have to come back and design software and be inclusive of the whole range of its users, which includes people who can’t pay for it. Therefore, you have to rethink business models so that you can run a business, sell your software, and also give it to the percentage of people who can never afford your services — you have to find ways to give it to them anyways so that they can get benefit from technology.LJ: What are some of the barriers in getting companies and organizations buy into the idea of tech for good?BT: The organizations and the people that work for them are easy to convince. They’ve always had to scrounge, make do, and do more with less. They never thought big tech is their partners, so it is new for them. In the past maybe they have gotten rejected, received second-class services, or they have been given solutions that don’t work for them. It is probably very frustrating for them. You know, again, people trying to solve other people’s problems. I think there’s a lot of barriers to bring them along. The mindset … maybe… to start off with.On the other side of the fence. I don’t know if the model is there. There’s probably a spectrum of Corporate Social Responsibility corporations that goes through to have the level of understanding or commitment or enlightenment (laugh) of doing good. There are a few stages: they go from “none,” to “throw money at it,” to “have a few token programs,” to “it [social responsibility] being a part of how they create value.” There’s this whole spectrum, and we have to push people up to this spectrum of becoming good citizens.The barriers on the corporate end are that these social organizations aren’t necessarily their growth curve. Nothing is stopping them, other than that they have to rethink their business models. Eventually, to start, it is going to have to come out of their profits somehow. They have to rethink what profit looks like — they have to rethink their supply chain. At Rebel we always go back to our supply chain. It doesn’t cost much to go up and down your supply chain and figure out ways you can serve people better. You have to rebuild your business basically — seems daunting — but maybe it is not as hard as you think.LJ: I’ve encountered a few types of organizations over the past: you have the ones that are great at raising money but not very innovative, and on the other end you have the smaller organizations that are pushing new concepts and innovative ways of tackling social issues but are horrible at getting funded. How can this dynamic change and how can resources be better distributed?BT: How can they get more resources? I’m not sure, that’s a clear problem, but they are tackling it already. There’re ways they can learn how to write grants or get access to different funding opportunities, but I don’t think I know this space that well other than some third-party understanding. How do companies and organizations with consistent funding get better at being more innovative? I think that’s where connections with the tech sector are important. This is where Civic Tech or Code4Canada fellowship comes in. We can have hackathons or lunch-and-learn to smash the different kinds of organizations together, or we can have fellowship programs that embed someone in an organization for 12–18 months. Those are great ways of getting expertise into organizations. I think the tech sector really need to create opportunities to share expertise so organizations can really start thinking innovatively.LJ: Coming back to Random Hacks of Kindness, what do the organizations or the participants think? What are their biggest takeaways or insights that they’ve shared with you?BT: Organizations that come, usually have an affinity to technology, to begin with. They get reaffirmed that there’re good people helping their organizations through technology. They are there to validate that concept. They now have the 10 people who are now invested in their cause, and will be there to help them and have produced some values. So they walk away with a set of new fans who would not have found them otherwise.Participants, some live in a silo for the most part. Chances are that they don’t usually need the services that the people they are working with [at Random Hacks of Kindness] offer. For example, housing problems, food insecurity… they may have kids that need educational services like the challenge cards or the robot project. So they’ll have some affinities to these programs. What I really like is when you see people venture out of their comfort zones and you force them to interact with frontline workers. You get to really understand what people across the city and the challenges that they face. So you get to work with the people who understand the problem and how it is to work with frontline communities and the essence of the issues they are solving. I think this is a huge empathy builder. I love that part of it. The participants come up to me and say that they didn’t know that these challenges existed.When they sign up to participate, there’s an input box asking why they are doing this. It is never about networking or getting a job. It is usually about that people want to give back, use their skills for a good cause, or help different organizations in their communities, that kind of things. So they walk away with a connection to that organization and also walk away with a better understanding of their own value and ways they can help.LJ: Speaking from my experience — some organizations I have encountered would hire someone cheap and end up with a poor product, and they have very little idea to how they can access resources or perhaps come to Random Hacks and get their projects off the ground.BT: Yea, that’s always a challenge. I wouldn’t recommend them to a small shop or a sole proprietor. It is a lot to ask of a small company for them to do work for free. I think I would suggest maybe a 5- or 7-person shop taking on one pro-bono project per year to give back. You are right, they can also come to RHoK, but there’re also some difficulties. We turn away some projects that are just “regular work.” I want people here to work on challenges. I don’t want participants to come here and just redesign a website or build fundraising tools. It is not rewarding for participants. I want people to feel they’re contributing to advancing the cause. This is definitely a gap, and unfortunately, organizations with needs in digital services have nowhere to turn to when they need service design, digital transformation, or service rethink. They can’t afford that, but they still need a hundred hours or more from a digital expert. That’s a big gap right now. Maybe it is a triangle situation where organization A has a need but cannot afford the cost, organization B delivers the work, but organization C pays organization B rather than having organization A pay for it. Like what happens in nature… symbiosis, you know. Sometimes companies have their Corporate Social Responsibility programs, but they don’t necessarily have the people or expertise to deliver to organizations that need it. It is in their mandate to help, but they need somebody to provide that service. Again, this is a situation where you need to be a little more creative. It is a gap so you might be able to experiment with this model.LJ: I feel this is more of a conversation that will happen at the “C-level,” isn’t it?BT: It is a little “C-level” kind of conversation right here. You will need someone that can champion the idea and get it to the decision-makers. Getting cash from people is hard. Or maybe we take money out of the situation and have your living expenses covered by providing you with things like food and shelter? I don’t know.LJ: This is where the scene cuts to me living in a house on a tropical island, working away on exciting projects. I can see it as a reality show. Anyways, would you say that there is a need for new business models in the not-for-profit space?BT: Yea. New ways of moving money and resources around. Everything takes money. Having to hire someone to raise enough to cover both the cost of fundraising and the real boost in productivity is not efficient. It is a waste of time to have 50 cents per dollar raised put to the cause. You did all the work and ended up only moving forward a little bit. If you can figure out a way to take money out of this situation, you can put all the energy into “doing good.” This is part of what Random Hacks represents. How do we get the expertise, the technology, and the opportunities straight to organizations in need without asking them to put their energy into coming up with the money first?LJ: It sounds to me that now is the time to rethink the cost of generosity and what putting a price-tag on generosity does to the sector. Is it ok to put a price tag on it?BT: That’s kind of the big question: everyone still operates in $. Should we even be talking in $? It is like asking people to measure happiness. How do you even measure happiness? To be able to measure impact or happiness is a big question because some people are trying to equate investment to the deployment of happiness, like “What can $1 get in happiness?”Some people ask these questions and do the calculations to put an amount on impact. For example, loneliness cost a certain amount in health services, staying out of prison is worth something, learning a skill and getting a job is worth something…when a person takes a course from a local social enterprise, that person can move out of community housing because she is now able to work, get paid, and support a family. There’s value in keeping people out of homelessness and situations like that.LJ: It is another new business model to consider. Just from my personal experience, sometimes organizations will have a smaller budget to start with, but once you dig deeper into their needs and get them to understand the value of the project to their organization, they do eventually come up with the amount they need to realize the project.BT: You have to be creative in getting the budget for sure. There isn’t a lot of money sitting around. For example, at Rebel, we are always putting money into hiring new people or investing in our services and products. We can give in products, time and expertise, but there isn’t a lot of cash just sitting around. Sponsorship in cash happens but will be strategic. Companies don’t usually have money sitting in the bank that’s not spoken for, so you have to be creative when it comes to asking for money.LJ: A lot of times it comes from knowing how companies or organizations operate. This means there’s an enormous benefit in understanding the business models of organizations and their value chain, what do you think?BT: Exactly. What we did in my last shop was that whenever we create a bid for a project, we also build the business case for the project sponsor to bring to their bosses. They can present the business case to their bosses and make sure that they understand the impact of the project. That’s the way to do it: you help them. You make it easy for them and coach them to communicate what is valuable for their company. You need to understand and have empathy for your buyers, your buyers’ clients or funders, you need to spend a day in their shoes. You might discover that what they need is not just a marketing project, but it also affects the business development. You will then be able to get the two departments to sponsor the project together and create more value for them that way.LJ: Especially in the not-for-profit scenario, it is never just about doing marketing or creating a campaign.BT: Yes. It is going to affect their entire operation and the people that they serve.rhok.caobj.ca----Nomadic LabsYOLO and Behold | Civic Tech | EntrepreneurLuisa Jiina floating space--Luisa JiinNomadic Labs--Luisa JiinNomadic Labs--Luisa JiinYOW-SF--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Luisa Ji,https://medium.com/@lvisaji,"9, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OhK6pw48moihDMgNaiEBbQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-1Y58i8l35iGZPRkfCw95g.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*DI4YA3e459G_g5ZT1zj1Ew.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*im9f9ZqmHy2HfVsLCUyKzA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kqO8X9hGNBuhc4wrmqVv6Q.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mNmgTSgVXknz2cxxVS7whg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*iZO-kPc4UlP0PWQSQMg4dw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*05zkzkX-DGF5hg0zOZV2wA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*tB76lATkl2TsbPY81pSqaA.jpeg",13,0

If you haven’t already, I suggest you read it. I’m not always Bezos biggest fan but in this case I say, bravo Mr. Bezos.Facebook keeps making headlines, much to their chagrin. This week the company turned 15 and there was plenty of reflection. Ben Mezrich, author of The Accidental Billionaires, claims he was right all along — arguing that Zuckerberg has a long history of betrayal, and that in light of recent privacy problems everyone, “knows a little bit what it feels like to be a Winklevoss.” Alexis Madrigal also wrote about Facebook’s history, his chronicle is full of great quotes from people who were there at the time, including, “So ‘invasion of privacy’ was actually in the very first email that I wrote to Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 in response to the first glimpse of the prototype.”But it wasn’t all slings and arrows, Klint Finley wrote for Wired that Facebook’s open source contributions have changed the world of computing for good. And the Financial Times wrote that Facebook seems to be improving in it’s battle against hate speech. Nevertheless, Facebook’s top PR announced she is leaving what must be an exhausting job.Cryptography and security luminary Bruce Schneier threw some shade at blockchain in an opinion piece for Wired, antagonistically titled There’s No Good Reason to Trust Blockchain Technology. Schneier makes a compelling case, even if his conclusion, “Honestly, cryptocurrencies are useless,” is bound to draw some ire. I loved Schneier’s piece, mostly because someone smarter than me is making some of the same arguments that I’ve also made.In other cryptocurrency news, a 20 year old was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a cryptocurrency theft scheme, and a big vulnerability in ZCash was fixed. Apparently the bug, which made counterfeiting ZCash possible, was discovered eight months ago and left unpatched until now. It’s discoverers say that identifying the bug required a great deal of cryptographic expertise, and that they haven’t found any evidence that it was ever exploited. Still, it’s fuel for Schneier’s position that perhaps trust in crypto is not so well placed.Ridesharing companies Lyft and Juno are suing New York City over a law that would require drivers on such platforms to make at least $17.22 per hour. Lyft and Juno are claiming that the change would favor their competitor, Uber, whose drivers are able to give more rides per hour due to Uber’s larger market share. Uber says they’re going to raise prices in order to comply with the law.Uber also released a new service this week: a public transportation integration in Denver. The collaboration allows users to navigate Denver’s train and bus lines via the Uber platform. The company says they have plans to allow users to buy tickets for public transit options via the app in future versions.Google announced some social good projects. Live Transcribe — a transcription application meant to help deaf people navigate in a world of spoken language, and Sound Amplifier — a tool that can, “augment and amplify the sounds in your environment,” like a hearing aid that can filter out white noise. They also open sourced a security tool called ClusterFuzz which helps software developers identify and fix a specific kind of security risk related to memory corruption.Google’s reputation as an employer has always been quite good, but Wired writer Nitasha Tiku reports that there is some continuing unrest among employees. Following the walkout over sexual misconduct in November, and the pay-gap spreadsheet from 2015, employees are now concerned about opaque payment practices — especially for the growing number of contractors who don’t enjoy many of the cushy Google benefits.In AI, Google Brain is training bots to play a unique collaborative card game called Hanabi in an attempt to develop an artificial “theory of mind” and researchers at the Allen Institute of AI are training bots to play Pictionary in an attempt to teach machines “common sense.” Outside of game playing, the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology wrote a fascinating piece in Nautilus about AI being used to map human brains, and Cade Metz argues in the New York Times that drug development will continue to be more dependent on AI for making breakthroughs.Finally, even though it’s not all that technological, my favorite science story of the week is a study that suggests bees can do arithmetic.

I couldn’t wait to attend this year, but I was concerned that the cost and requesting the time off would be a barrier.Luckily, the support of two key organizations made this possible. Firstly, I am grateful to have received a scholarship from anitab.org to attend Grace Hopper once again. And my current company — Project Rōnin — was more than supportive and accommodating. They allowed me to be 100% present at the event in order to get the most out of the experience.On the ground, I attended an array of talks about products, technology, career development, and networking events; ALL featuring WOMEN keynote speakers!“I have chosen the perfect career path for me and the future of technology.”Being an underrepresented woman in technology is difficult sometimes. However, attending events that grant you the opportunity to be around such a large group of women from all socioeconomic backgrounds, races, and ages is invigorating. I left feeling empowered, and my sense of belonging in the technology field significantly increased. It was, without a doubt, a fantastic learning and networking opportunity.Above all, this experience has reassured me that I have chosen the perfect career path for me and the future of technology. Attending this year was as amazing as the first and I am eager to return back to work to share my takeaways with my colleagues and the “wōmin” of Rōnin!I look forward to attending next year — I will see you all there!Project Rōnin is hiring.

221,45370,https://medium.com/@enekas/design-transformation-ed5236245fd9?source=tag_archive---------105-----------------------,Design Transformation,Education,"EnekasFollow--ListenShareSome of the world largest industrial design consultancies are being bought out by other companies like the case of Ideo and Designit, under statements like preparing for the future, gaining strategic advantage or expanding. While for these companies it might be because of their business dynamics that such decisions have been made, I think these events also point to a problem how industrial design as a discipline is taught and practiced which can either either allow it to leapfrog or become irrelevant for the economies it exists in.First and most important issue to consider is education designers receive. Design is a discipline that at its core, takes the responsibility of commodifying outcomes from STEM fields and social sciences. While the perspective of how this topic is approached by different schools can change, the core mission remains the same. This can be observed well particularly in new deviations of design as a discipline. Fields leading to creation of branches like social design, business design, user experience and many more which maybe don’t exist yet are only examples of this trend. In basic terms, new fields of design can emerge from its intersection with any other discipline it gets in contact with. One of the reasons for this might be the need for specialization among designers in areas which they work on as these fields are mainly formed in higher educationThere are two main challenges designers are facing today, one is that most designers are lacking tools to interpret other disciplines in order to apply design knowledge and methods in these areas. Second, is that design in nature is an applicational field and so its theoretical edges must be marked and distincted.Industrial Design was developed to find methods and solutions to make new products and technologies usable by the mass market. There are many examples of how design has throughout time commodified research and new technologies with the examples of Wedgwood potteries, Apple’s first computers, materials like Teflon transformed from NASA research being only few of them. While speed of scientific and technological advancement has been increasing constantly, it has also been diversifying and branching in itself through multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary interactions. While maybe a designer only had to follow up with few branches of innovation 20 years ago, today it is almost an impossible task. Luckily with increasing speed of information transfer through digital media this act of scouting is also easing (Hopefully Neuralink will soon connect us all to do it even faster).Second issue is that, yes design is an applicational field, but it doesn’t have to be a mechanical one. Defining design into brainstorming methods, mapping methods and such is undermining. Design Thinking, UX methods and similar approaches are methods, not knowledge.Today, design takes the responsibility of commodifying information. This could be scientific data, community interactions, individual thoughts or even our collective memory.So far this has been the only framework in which I have been able to think and define all design disciplines. But based on this, design research and practice divide into two main groups. Activities which are on exploring and defining data domains, and second are activities that are focused on finding use cases and application methods for selected data sets.The question is however, are we equipped with the tools to understand and manage the commodification process for knowledge in an ever evolving context?----RestingEnekasinThe Junction--2Enekas--Enekas--Enekas--Daily Design--Christina SainUX Planet--64Michal Malewicz--24Elvis HsiaoinBootcamp--1Ryan FordinUX Collective--55Derek Boman--3HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Enekas,https://medium.com/,1,3,91

Watching TV is the nation’s most common leisure activity, with the average American watching around five hours every day. Additionally, studies have shown that 60 percent of consumers are likely to make a purchase after viewing an advertisement on TV compared to only slightly over 40 percent for viewing ads online or over social media.In contrast, radio audiences tend to be more segmented and smaller because of the larger number of local stations compared with television. Because local TV stations are fewer, audiences are spread into larger segments of people who will see your ad. Also, the widespread appeal of TV may make consumers more receptive to TV advertising compared with other media. Many audiences are interested in and attracted to creative, well-made TV advertisements as demonstrated in the popular hype over Super Bowl commercials.Other advantages of advertising on television are the ability to target specific audiences and expand reach by encouraging further engagement on social media. Advertisers can target their audience by purchasing ad spots during shows their intended demographic is likely to be watching. Toy manufacturers may want to advertise during Saturday morning cartoons, for example, while a local bar and grill may want to advertise during sporting events. Business owners can choose to advertise with independent or local TV stations to further narrow the demographic focus.Both reach and brand awareness can be expanded as advertisers encourage viewers to engage with their product while using additional technology and social media outlets. Over 70 percent of television viewers use an additional device such as a tablet or smartphone while watching TV and are often engaged with friends online at the same time. Advertisers can encourage engagement by instructing viewers to enter a sweepstakes online or visit their website. Viewers are also more likely to text friends about a product they just saw advertised or search for more information on a product in which they are interested.A captive audience and no additional competition are other advantages of TV ads. Even if only for a few seconds, a TV ad puts only your product is in the spotlight. This contrasts with newspapers, telephone directories or other print media where ads may be relatively small and placed directly alongside competitor ads. In radio, listeners frequently listen to several stations by flipping through the radio dial, so advertisers might need to advertise on many stations to reach their intended audiences and consumers may encounter competitors’ products.Although TV advertisements are more costly to produce than other ads and commercial air time can be expensive, promotional material on television is the most influential because consumers trust it above other mediums. It has the advantage of sophistication ahead of any other medium because it combines both visual and auditory stimulation. Interesting camera angles, and the combination of pictures and words is not only more exciting, but gives a more realistic view of a product than a single static photograph. Television advertising has the ability to show a product, demonstrate its use and explain the benefits of ownership or consumption.----DANVISKODanvisko com--1Danvisko cominDANVISKO--Danvisko cominDANVISKO--Danvisko com--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Christina SainUX Planet--64Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Danvisko com,https://medium.com/@danvisko2,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*QfLtzlupFWfzN7C0uDjbwQ.png",3,0

Apple이 얼마나 iPad를 중요하게 생각하는지 알 수 있는 대목이었다. 그런데 한편으로는 굳이 운영체제를 나눌 필요가 있는가 하는 생각이 들었다.지금 글로벌 소프트웨어 기업들의 OS근황을 보면 먼저 Google은 안드로이드, 크롬OS 두 가지의 OS를 가지고 있지만 안드로이드는 워치, 폰, 테블릿, TV 등과 크롬을 통해 기기가 인터넷에 연결되있을 때 사용하기 좋은 서비스를 제공한다.Apple은 이번 iPadOS의 발표로 iOS, Mac OS, tvOS, watchOS와 같이 각각의 기기를 구별하여 최적화되고 깔끔한 소프트웨어를 소비자에게 제공한다. Google과 Apple 두 회사는 각자의 방식으로 여러기기에서 사용하기 좋은 OS를 제공한다는 것이다.반면, Microsoft(MS)사는 PC OS인 Windows만 강세를 보이고 모바일 영역과 TV, Watch 등 다른 기기에서 사용할 수 있는 OS를 공개하지 않고 있다. MS의 노키아 인수 실패로 인한 모바일 사업타격의 여파에서 아직 빠져나오지 못하고 있는 듯하다.다른 제품군에서의 Windows OS가 아예 없다는 것은 아니다 Windows ioT와 여러 모습으로 존제한다. 하지만 출시된 OS가 최적화의 문제로 이용자들에게 불만족스러운 경험을 주고 또 Google이나 Apple의 OS들이 MS Windows의 PC OS자리까지 위헙하고 있다.이런 일을 예견이라도 한듯 MS는 클라우드 사업과 다른 미래 먹거리를 찾고있다. 클라우드 컴퓨팅 서비스인 Azure와 Onedrive를 필두로한 Office 서비스가 대표적이다. 실제로 클라우드 사업의 효과로 MS의 주가는 상승세를 이어갔다. 하지만 OS에서 만족스러운 경험을 제공하지 못한다면 다른 사업들도 힘들어질 수 있다는 우려가 된다.MS는 Windows를 iOT와 xBOX와 같은 서비스를 사용하여 홈관리 소프트웨어를 만드는 방향으로 개발해 나아가야 된다고 생각된다. 이는 Windows가 가지고 있는 그래픽의 취약성을 어시스턴트 서비스(Cortana)를 통해 극복할 수 있는 방법이라고 본다.미래에는 가정마다 중앙컴퓨터를 두어 가족 구성원 개인의 데이터를 내부 저장소에 저장하고 그 데이터를 기반으로 필요한 서비스를 제공해야 한다.디스플레이와 셋톱박스가 분리된 기기가 생길 수도 있지만 기술의 발전으로 TV가 그 역활을 현재와 같이 수행할 수도 있다.현재의 어시스턴트 기능을 탑재한 스피커와 TV, PC등이 하나로 묵이게 되거나 네트워크를 통해 연결될 것이다.어시스턴트는 커스터마이즈가 가능하고 집 내부에만 데이터를 저장하여 가정만다 데이터 센터역활을 하게 만들어야 한다.----Hanee--Hanee--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Hanee,https://medium.com/@Hanee,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EZvACjBDoGcieuududwhPw.jpeg",3,0

KWHCoin is rapidly developing the physical and digital infrastructure to enable end users to advantage this transformational opportunity in the energy sector.KWHCoin COO Monica Shepard, shared a presentation to demonstrate the KWHCoin Smart Grid system and its focus on renewable energy generation, peer to peer distribution and blockchain technology to secure and manage the network functioning.Click here to view.www.pscp.tvThe current energy ecosystem consists of generation, distribution and consumption and takes on the following characteristics. The three major categories for electricity generation are fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and petroleum), nuclear and renewable energy with fossil fuels dominating generation resources.Electricity is distributed by high voltage electricity from the high-voltage transmission lines which passes through step-down transformers that lower the voltage. The electricity is then transmitted to a network of local electric distribution lines for consumption by end users.KWHCoin has developed a system which coordinates distributed energy resources (DER’s) namely, solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations, wind, biomass, solar home systems to provide generation. The internet will be used as a rail for distribution and coordination of these resources. The end user, now empowered, potentially becomes a prosumer (both consumer and producer of electricity) and the blockchain based software platform will manage and secure the renewable energy network along with the value generated.“This live video is the first in a series because we want to be able to fully explain the benefits of blockchain technology and how it relates to supporting our growing ecosystem at KWHCoin,” states KWHCoin COO Monica Shepard.Come join us and follow us on social media at the links below.Join us on Telegram ==> https://t.me/kwhcoin to find get information regarding immediate opportunities.Twitter==> https://twitter.com/KwhCoinFacebook==> https://www.facebook.com/KWHCoinInstagram==>https://www.instagram.com/kwhcoinrenewableenergyKWHCoin is traded on digital currency exchanges around the world.www.topbtc.comhttps://idex.market/eth/kwhairswap.io/kwhwww.coinexmarket.iowww.bitfex.tradehttps://www.ecoinbank.cc/deal/KWH_ETH?notice=1----KWHCoin is a cryptocurrency developing the physical and digital assets to deploy the internet of energy and power billions with renewable energy access.KWHCoin--KWHCoin--KWHCoin--KWHCoin--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",KWHCoin,https://medium.com/@kwhcoinnetzero,"9, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wcx3FCnOu26tOgzR2zBYWQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*S3Th-gaunfXLQFVNqYfGTw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*d-Tm7OsQLMux_iVTp5JCdA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HuUXlLAXFTNc59X1NDOiiw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*lM5wYK6UZG8_5BglL4K5zQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JqZ9R8A8PVEaKvZMURsUrg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*QVWaJBNTu_pmZTmW6_EEvQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vObee2fTFujaK_WAAFBxeQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VXZlFLPdarQdWXZAAXXUjg.jpeg",3,1

Trends like IOT(internet of things), machine learning, virtual reality etc became the icing to the pudding. So, in this article I will be highlighting the future of software industry.The software industry is continuously expanding in India. It is a leading destination for the IT and IT-enabled services worldwide. India is the preferred destination for companies and their business needs. The factors that attract potential investors are the huge talent pool offered by India, good infrastructure, and low costs. What’s driving the software industry in India is the quality of services being offered.Let us take a dataset of “Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results 2019” to understand the future of software industry.The dataset is a CSV file that contains details of different individuals that are working as a developer or would be working as a developer in future.Let’s get the information about the data given:From the above picture, we can depict that there are 88883 rows and 85 columns.The above picture depicts all the 85 columns present in the dataset.If we dig deeper into this dataset, we would see there are five different types of individuals present. They are:Since it is not convenient to proceed our analysis with all the types, so i choose “I am a developer by profession” in MainBranch.Here, in the above we can see that there are 170 countries present for the developer. Since it will not be convenient to use all the 170 countries, i choose India as the country. Besides this, i also kept those developers whose age is more than 22. Hence we are done with the cleaning of data, and thus we will proceed with the next stepOnce you see the data and clean it you might come up with a variety of questions.From the above plot we can observe that the most of the developers are of computer science, computer engineering or software engineering background, and it can be validated also, because these backgrounds are purely based on coding only.2. How much educated are the developers in India?From the above plot we can observe that the most of the developers are having doctorate degree. So from here we can conclude that developers are nowdays highly educated.3. What is the age range of developers in India?From the above plot we can observe that the age range for the developers lies between 20s to 30s. Even there r quiet number of developers of age between 30 to 40 as well.4. What are the most used social media app by the developers of India?From the above plot, we can observe that the three most used social media apps by the developers are Hello, WeChat and YouTube. Even there are also quiet a number of developers who do not use any social media.5. How many years the developers of India are into coding?From the above plot, we can observe that the most of the developers are coding for nearly 9 years.6. To which part, most of the developers belong ?From the above plot we can observe that most of the developers belong to South Asia (86.30%), a few from East Asia (9.44%) and rest are from other parts.India’s software industry has an early start than most countries by capitalizing on her endless pool of young software engineers, but there is always lack of innovation and complacency. Another bugbear is the lack of utilities infrastructure and stable electricity power supply. This is the reason why India is unable to produce an Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Tencent or Alibaba equivalent.----Surabhi BasakinCampusX--Surabhi Basak--Surabhi Basak--Surabhi Basak--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Surabhi Basak,https://medium.com/@2titi4,"13, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*Dvv1POhtrTL21FFA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hGSooHD7JuJrjsJ2HKtDGQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kbcQ_IeiM8j3hvNY6Y6O-w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*G2r_p7a1QQpTFBDw16W8Uw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*aYlCeReq0OpcVGH9iKUDAw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*o0vyfcCcABkeZwjNc7sb_w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*XCJwPWgr6hEBDxKBE4JhAg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ajQ5OMjsxyBGj9lE-EZ9Wg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8sEnJLO-Eu2aaZOBIg1aXw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Cd0yXNu4BiqOD4P-fWxeTA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VEhrYMbWpn5mF5dlJ2b3bQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*NzeSA3SatRGCUyntcGqspg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*MNNmikmXjvQhA27Nn0u19A.jpeg",5,51

Are you wondering what accelerometer is right for your application? Should you go with a quartz flexible accelerometer?There are different types of accelerometers. Determining the best accelerometer for your application begins with a basic understanding of what they do and how they are applied.Measurement applicationsAccelerometers are designed to measure levels of acceleration. There are various applications where accelerometers are required including:1. Measuring motionMotion can be simply defined as a change in velocity or position. Examples of motion include waves, change in orientation. This also includes sustained acceleration such as when a rocket is taking off.2. Measuring vibrationsVibrations are motions oscillating about a particular position of equilibrium. Examples of vibration include a turbine or electric motor. Vibrations can be measured in different instances including monitoring heart beats or detecting resonance.3. Measuring shockThis involves measuring sudden changes in acceleration. Some examples include drop tests, testing the efficiency of shock absorbers and auto crash tests.Types of accelerometer responsesAccelerometers can be categorized in various ways. One way is by the type of response the accelerometer uses. Thus there are two types of accelerometers:a) AC response accelerometersThese are AC coupled accelerometers. They can’t be used to measure sustained accelerations or slow vibrations. They are preferred for measuring vibrations as they are able to provide responses over a wide frequency. They also offer high signal-to-noise ratio.b) DC response accelerometersThese accelerometers respond to direct current only. They can be used to measure very slight changes in acceleration. They are often used to measure sustained accelerations. They can also be used to measure shock where these measurements are to be integrated with other acceleration data such as changes in velocity.Types of accelerometer technologyAccelerometers can also be categorized based on the technology used to construct them including:1. Capacitive MEMS accelerometerThese accelerometers are fabricated using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). This technology enables accelerometers to be manufactured at a lower cost. It also allows for the manufacture of smaller accelerometers. MEMS accelerometerThe smaller size and lower cost makes these capacitors a popular choice for printed circuit boards and other applications requiring surface mounting.2. Piezoelectric accelerometersThese are typically constructed with a sensing element made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT). This element produces an electric charge proportional to the acceleration the unit is under. These accelerometers have good sensitivity, respond to wide frequencies and are easy to install.3. Piezoresistive accelerometersThese are often used for DC response. They have a very wide bandwidth and are often used for measuring high frequency shock events. They can also measure down to as little as zero hertz. They are therefore also used to measure displacement.With this basic information, you can determine the best accelerometer for your application.----Do you need an accelerometer?

It’s an interesting system to “duplicate” into a computer system, a system that can do its prevention when the “virus” comes, and a system that can heal itself.Winto can possibly implement this miraculous Human Body System in computer technology. In engineering, this healing system is known as Safety Engineering.Safety engineering is an applied science strongly related to Systems Engineering. Safety engineering aims to insure that a life-critical system behaves as needed, even when something doesn’t work the way it supposed to. Safety Engineering is often reactionary to adverse events, also described as “incidents,” as reflected in accident statistics.For Winto the true success of his work is when he and his team is no longer needed. As a System Reliability Engineer (SRE) Winto and his team is trying to develop an auto-scale system. This system can automatically scale quickly up and down in response to load in order to save money, without violating service level agreements as a diagnostic and predictive tool. As a result this would allow dynamic scaling, automatic reaction to performance, correctness problems, and generally automatic management of many aspects of these systems.Every work that Winto does is from the heart. He is not only dedicated to job, but he is also responsible. He remembers waking up 3 in the morning when the server was down to make sure everything was in control and under maintenance. He always encourages his team have the #ProCustomer mindset like him, because when they they share the same mindset it will be easier to achieve their goal together.Even with the technology advancement today, Winto thinks his plan will take time. Right now he’s focusing on making his team stronger, so they can solve challenging problems and become more innovative. Winto has faith that him and his team will achieve this goal.(Kurniagusta Dwinto/Icha Prakoso/Belle Vianco).----lifeatFAZZFAZZFORWARDinlifeatFAZZ--Nadya NaftaliainlifeatFAZZ--FAZZFORWARDinlifeatFAZZ--FAZZFORWARDinlifeatFAZZ--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",FAZZFORWARD,https://medium.com/@FAZZFORWARD,0,2,127

Bitcoin, for example, can be useful for circumventing the financial system (getting around capital controls), in places where the financial system is failing (e.g. Venezuela), or where it isn’t allowed (e.g. Silk Road). On a day to day basis, crypto purchases are limited to novelty payments made by enthusiasts (like the infamous Bitcoin pizza).What is the path forward?Realistically we’re probably at least a decade away, but here’s a guess. I would think that crypto-payments first gain a foothold in countries with weak financial systems, then become increasingly mainstream as they gain a critical mass of payment volume.The vital long-term problems to be solved: A) technology needs to be become more scalable and robust, and B) there need to be excellent mobile integrations.While the first seems obvious, for the second, note how in China, their developing payments system largely skipped credit cards and skipped almost directly towards mobile payments. For emerging countries that must upgrade their payment systems or replace a failing existing financial system in coming years, there’s no reason that a scalable, mobile-first cryptocurrency can’t be the next step beyond mobile payments.Following the long-term trend of the overall crypto market, greater market capitalization and further maturity of the speculative crypto ecosystem should also encourage greater price stability. Even with low levels of initial adoption, this could lead to a virtuous cycle where lower crypto volatility leads to greater payments demand leads to lower volatility, etc.A major downturn would speed payments adoption in emerging marketsA major glocal economic downturn could lead to less stable governments and weaker currencies. This could benefit not only the crypto market as a whole, but payments cryptocurrencies specifically due to less trust in emerging governments and their likely weaker currencies.The crypto market as a whole has never existed in a global economic bear market, as Bitcoin was released in 2009 only after the financial crsis. If another major downturn were to happen, and central banks depreciated their currencies, a strengthening of alternative asset classes (e.g. cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities) would be likely to happen. As a relatively tiny asset class, cryptocurrencies could be expect to rise much more than larger, older asset types.Even if this thesis weren’t to play out, people in countries with damaged financial systems and weaker currencies could increasingly turn to easily obtainable currencies that would not lose all value if existing governments or banking systems fell. If no dollars were available, these emerging markets citizens might consider putting their money in payment cryptocurrencies.These would not only enable everyday payments, or preserve value in the case of actual national crisises, but also provide insurance as others might further turn to the currency if the situation became worse.There would probably also be demand to send money across borders, either in less liquid cryptocurrencies or payments cryptocurrencies, or bypass possible capital controls, would further increase demand.Focus long-term, and globally, for payments adoptionFor the many teams are hard at work building out payments technology & integrations, it’s worth keeping in mind the idea that traction may be gradual, and on the fringes.Even if adoption starts in the coming years in places like Venezuela or sub-Saharan Africa, far out of sight, we may still be on the right long-term course.From the Distributed Horizons blog----CryptoTrading--CryptoTrading--CryptoTrading--CryptoTrading--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Unbecoming--768HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",CryptoTrading,https://medium.com/@achan7754,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ditdzJ4t2oNfTR2uo7azGw.jpeg",4,0

Read on to find out more…In a mock press conference posted to his Twitter feed, Richard Tyler Blevins, better-known by his handle “Ninja”, announced he would be moving his streaming presence entirely from Twitch to the Microsoft-owned streaming platform Mixer. In the video he says the move will hopefully give him a chance to get back to his roots, although as of yet he hasn’t provided any detail as to what that might mean for his content.The move came as a shock to many, especially considering Twitch largely contributed to Ninja’s mainstream popularity; streaming exclusively on Twitch, he has grown his following by more than ten times since his main game, Fortnite, released in September of 2017, and he now has more than 14 million followers on the platform.Despite this, the streamer seems unconcerned with potential controversy in his announcement video, appearing relaxed and even cracking a few jokes. This attitude is thus far proving warranted; since the move earlier this week, over 500,000 of Ninja’s fans have followed him over on the new platform.Ninja is now streaming at mixer.com/Ninja, if you’d like to take a look for yourself.In a somewhat baffling turn of events, Colin Moriarty’s hugely successful Sacred Symbols: A Playstation Podcast had its panel status revoked by PAX West organisers — despite the same organisers telling Moriarty explicitly that he should promote his attendance to fans, presumably in order to encourage ticket sales.Moriarty took to Twitter to document the drama as it unfolded. The PAX team originally sent him a one-paragraph email stating “we unfortunately have to remove your panel from the PAX West 2019 schedule”. In a series of follow-up emails, Moriarty asks to know the reason for the decision, requests reimbursement for fans who may have purchased PAX tickets for the express purpose of attending his panel, and also requests reimbursement for the travel expenses he and his co-host, Chris Ray Gun, undertook in order to attend the convention.Twenty-four hours after the initial cancellation, the PAX team responded to Moriarty, but neglected to give a reason as to the cancellation. They also state that while they will process travel refunds for Colin and Chris, the unlucky customers who purchased passes specifically to attend the Sacred Symbols panel would not be refunded as “point of sale indicates all content is subject to change”. Soon after receiving this email, Moriarty again posted on Twitter, promising to refund twenty fans the $55 PAX attendance fee out of his own pocket on a first-come, first-served basis.At time of publishing he hasn’t confirmed on Twitter that these refunds have been processed, but he has since stated that many CLS fans and patrons offered their own money, advice, and encouragement to help those affected by the PAX team’s decision.According to an article on Rockstar’s official website, an update to Red Dead Online later this summer will introduce a role system, allowing players to have more control over the way they play they game, and earn unique rewards and benefits according to that play style.Alongside a slew of other quality-of-life updates like smoother controls, improvements to the Offensive and Defensive player system, and more common in-game loot, players will soon be able to choose between three roles; Bounty Hunter, Trader, and Collector.Bounty hunters will focus on tracking special bounties to gain access to their items and abilities, which will include the reinforced lasso for “ extra-tough targets” and the ability to use Eagle-Eye while sprinting or galloping, as well as new gun-spinning tricks.Traders are able to establish a business from the relative safety of their own camp, using the furs, skins, and meat from wild animals to produce valuable products that can then be sold on for profit. This role will eventually yield access to hunting wagons, weapons lockers, and satchel upgrades.Collectors will spend their time “searching for lost jewelry, rare arrowheads and other treasures to sell as individual pieces or highly valuable sets”, and will unlock refined binoculars and metal detectors to aid them in the pursuit of this goal.There’s no word on when the update will go live, so keep your eyes on Rockstar’s website (or on our incredibly helpful news roundups) for further updates.Yes, it’s that time of the month again, where PlayStation gamers find themselves divided between joy and outrage at the PS Plus free games of the month. This time around, you can gain access to the futuristic Wipeout Omega Collection and gory but satisfying Sniper Elite 4.Wipeout is a VR-compatible, futuristic racing game originally released in 2017, made up of the HD remasters of Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD, including the relevant DLC. Players can enjoy competitive multiplayer with up to eight players online and two players offline.Also released in 2017, Sniper Elite 4 features the series’ returning protagonist Karl Fairburne as he assists the Italian Resistance in its attempt to free the country from fascism. The game offers a single-player campaign, as well as both cooperative and competitive online multiplayer.The combined value of the games on the PS Store is over £65, so remember to add both games to your library to really get your money’s worth this month.----Game CopingCCCU graduate.

For now, the priority is to swiftly control the damage, work closely with the relevant law enforcement agencies and keep the relevant stakeholders updated. For the majority of employees at Fusion, we are back to business-as-usual, with our focus on building out the remainder of Fusion’s technology and progressing with our adoption roadmaps.We are sharing updates here on Medium and also Tweeting out on Fusion’s official Twitter channel.As was stated by a community member shortly after the Fusion wallet theft, this is hardly the first incident of a compromised wallet in the industry. There are numerous examples where projects have come back stronger after an incident of this nature.The way the community has stood by the project is inspiring and is testament to the strength of our vision. Since the Fusion token sale in Feb 2018, we have had a strong core community who we cannot thank enough for their immense contribution to the project.We have been particularly impressed by community members who have seen the positives in the unfortunate theft of Sept 28. We really believe that this incident will further galvanise the team and community to ensure we succeed in the future.Despite all this support, the team is not ignorant of the theft’s impact on our community. However, we now have two options before us: 1) continue to operate in regret or 2) to move decisively forward — learn from the theft, quickly work to restore the stolen tokens, and bring everyone’s focus back to the Fusion technology.----An Exciting New Era of Cryptofinance for the Internet of Values.FUSION Foundation--1FUSION FoundationinThe Fusion Time-Lock technology as additional asset protection.--FUSION Foundation--FUSION Foundation--1Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",FUSION Foundation,https://medium.com/,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*gSV3NvEFgbchEbMwozi06A.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EL9LkJaM0LoQp1izQ7dMPA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1bfHc2rV-svHVWDGLzhvtg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2ojcifrSwR-hJsk2izKvrQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*J8jpDFNA6xIZsFvKNP7g7w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-A4y5DAk-LvqHA6CMoMTgw.png",3,64

We’re literally the United Nations inside one family.The company under 20 words:Burst Learning is about helping people get the skills they need for a job they love, on their mobile device.What my company name & logo means:Burst Learning opens the doors to continual learning throughout a person’s life. People learn better in Bursts of learning, just like the way they interact with social media — hence the name Burst Learning!The logo represents bridges to learning that can be built over time, or “By Degrees”Why I started the company & my journey so far:Once upon a time a degree or diploma lasted a person’s lifetime. Today, people don’t get the huge benefit that a degree used to give them in terms of dollars and job certainty. And as online learning started to take off, only 5% of people completed their courses. And fraud has become a real problem, devaluing everyone’s qualifications. So we needed to address all of these issues. We wanted to create a solution where people could learn any-time, anywhere on devices they have in their pocket. We wanted them to learn in Bursts, just like the way they use social media which people find so addictive. And we wanted to make sure more people completed their courses than dropped out — gaining a credential that employers trust.  I have been very fortunate to find some incredible support. The former CTO of Nokia and British Telecom is a director on my Board and we have an incredible development and support team in New Delhi, India who have developed the first version of our platform.  Microsoft have embraced us by awarding “Co-Sell Ready” status and “Managed Partner” status, both of which have been incredible in terms of sourcing high quality leads.  And our first customers are loving the product — we have as our first enterprise customer the largest private hotel group in Australia.My lightbulb advice:Follow your dream, but make sure that you also get the help you need to get the business fundamentals right.

CookFollow--ListenShareYou, like many, probably started your microcontroller journey with an Arduino Uno. Eventually though, chances are you moved on to smaller boards like the Nano, which measures in at just 1.77” x .71”, or the even tinier Pro Micro at 1.3” x .7”. Nionics, however, has announced a new board called the ATTO that they claim is the world’s smallest Arduino-compatible. It comes in a minuscule .45” x .40” form factor, which works out to just an .18-square-inch area. To get a sense of its size, consider that the Nano has a comparatively massive 1.26-square-inch footprint.The ATTO features the same ATmega32U4 as the Pro Micro, allowing it to act as a custom human interface device (HID) if you so desire. It even has a built-in RGB LED for your blinking needs. A microUSB port provides power and programming for the board, or a VIN pin can accept between 3.3 and 13V.To pull off this little package, IO pins are reduced compared to some of its full-sized cousins, and you’ll need to deal with a smaller pin pitch than you’re probably used to at .05” (or use an adapter). Also, it won’t be available until October. But if you can wait a few months, it looks like a great way to embed intelligence where a dev board couldn’t have fit previously!----Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.Jeremy S.

According to the news, he was a South Korean war hero. He enjoyed running to the Korean War Veterans Center in Rancho Cordova, California to shoot @#$! and play hwatu with people I like to imagine had similar stories.I wish he shared more.My fathers ancestors were part of the Popham Colonists in Maine. Over generations, some of our family settled in the North, some in the South. There is a Plumb House (Historic) in Virginia and a Plumb Abolitionist Monument in New York.

Rumor has it they are still at war with each other.My grandfather was a smooth talker and a womanizer.My grandfather was a coal miner, as was his father.. and his father.

She came from a loving family that were secluded in the Appalachian mountains. Her purpose in life was to help other women raise children until she could raise children of her own. Her family were the soft and tender kind of people.

I’ll remember that I deserve better too, always!My father came from very poor people and needed to make a life for himself. After a fallout with his brother and an episode of belligerent jealousy pointed at a woman, he ran away to join the Air Force. Some say he built runways in active combat zones. Some say he killed men. He had a very private life and his stories were as tall as his lies.I don’t know much about his youth other than he was a womanizer and a disco king. He loved fast cars, bell bottoms and partying. I knew him as a man who had dissociative states of anger and who fought for his daughter the best he could.My mother came from a wealthy family that never gave her any personal wealth; ironically, my grandmother (Radical Rice Feminist) left everything to her son. She raised her three siblings while her mother was dying of cancer.My mother went to a technical school, her first job was a bus attendant. During this time, my mother won a Karaoke talent show where the winner would become a famous singer.

She was a mess hall house keeper. She liked working on base because she was allowed to shop at the commissary. They had fruit and meat, which at the time, were Korean delicacies. The only word of english my mom knew was ‘Finishee’ meaning, “Are you finished with your meal plate?”.My dad asked her to go out on a date with him 3 times before she said anything other than “Finishee”. I am not sure if thats because she didn’t speak english or because he was Caucasian. There was a lot of anti-nationalism pointed at Americans after the war.He was the first man who ever gave her flowers.My mother once told me she married my father because he wouldn’t beat her like a Korean man would.They got married in South Korea during the Spring. My father didn’t speak any Korean and my mother didn’t speak any English. A few weeks shy of nine months, my brother was born. Shortly after their marriage they moved to the United States.My mother once told me she married my father because he wouldn’t beat her like a Korean man would. Another time she was worried he’d abandon her in the woods. She said she’d call her grandmother and weep, wanting to go home. I believe her.Over the years, she immigrated her siblings and her father to the United States.My mother had control issues and a fragile ego.I prefer to honor my brothers privacy. He has had a very disadvantaged life. I hope some day he has a story to share.I am a child of immigrants, activists, laborers and war. With that came a lot of volatility in our family dynamic. We weren’t poor people, but we weren’t wealthy people either. Addiction — both drug and gambling ran rampant in our family. Greed and status were more important than love and kindness. Mental health problems (dissasociative disorder, borderline personality disorder, sociopathy, narcissism, PTSD, compulsive lying, kleptomania, addiction..) made typical social interactions with other human beings impossible at home.Gambling was frequently more important than clothes, food, and housing.Between their emotional immaturity and anger, my parents didn’t have a lot of time to raise their children. My brother had special needs and needed attention. I was gifted and needed attention. They had no time, money, or attention to give.I was a 4.0 student, with a photographic memory, synesthesia, and exceptional academic and physical capabilities. I could self teach my self anything. I enjoyed reading the Encyclopedia Britannica in my spare time. I was painfully socially awkward. My parents were blissfully unaware of my condition. I thought everyone hallucinated pictures and colors until my twenties.We grew up in poor people neighborhoods that attracted violence and drugs. I would get called names like, ”Big word using fu#$ing weirdo.”, and frequently asked, ”You think you’re so smart.” I was alone.I recall being chased home by my brothers adversaries, who poured salt in my eyes because of a disagreement. I recall our friendly neighborhood crack dealer. Everyone around me were crazy, tired, hungry, and poor.After going bankrupt, they moved us out of the ghetto into a dilapidated home in a smaller community.After our move, my father would find computers in trash cans and bring them home to me. I remember my first computer. He pointed at it, looked at me, and said “Learn this. This is important.”, and then walked away.My first computer was an IBM PC (5150) that ran on DOS. Every year, my father consistently delivered a new (old) computer for me to learn on. My mother despised of computers.My mother expected me to become a doctor, engineer, or lawyer. I would go to college, graduate, and support her poor financial decisions. I was not on board with this plan. I wanted to move to the city, live in an old house, meet amazing people, and design useful software. Since I was 8 years old that was always my plan.Unfortunately, my mother was selfish, hard, and inflexible. She tried to control my path, every day, relentlessly, for 18 years straight.I am disowned by my Korean family. Their loss.There were daily shouting matches over the computer, more specifically, my use. Despite the turbulence his choices created, my father kept bringing new computers home for me to learn and new shouting matches would ensue. I kept learning through the noise in the background of this domestic battle.Dad, for this I am grateful.

After her businesses went bankrupt, I was able to get jobs at my mothers friends restaurants.We were manufactured into poverty by her gambling addiction, so I had to make my own money. Through high school I held down numerous fast food jobs. I had no work acumen or social skills — this was very difficult.By my junior year, my GPA was below 1. I had missed 52 days of school. I entered an alternative program at 16.I remember my father shouting, “C is average! She is still passing! Calm down.” My mother would combat with, “No A is average! A spells average!”Insert blood curdling screams, objects slamming, and physical violence.Life wasn’t easy, I was miserable.My mother told me I was a failure, a stupid ass. That I should get a government or health care job and stop using the stupid computer.That sentiment remains today.At the age of 18 I landed my first job as a web developer. At 19, I received my GED. I dropped in and out of college a dozen times, hoping to become a Bio-Medical Engineer, all the while paying for college by means of graphic design and web development work. I didn’t listen to my heart until I was 22, when I founded a series of failed and successful businesses.This is where my new story begins. I didn’t always share that I was a high school drop out, college drop out, I aced the GED test, and that I was forced to work starting at the age of 8. Or that I have a photographic memory, the ability to map data in my head, or synesthesia. Or that I came from a dysfunctional family.Now that I am here, secure in my self, I feel like I can finally share my story.I am resilient because of a turbulent family history, divorce, becoming a single mother and homelessness.My name is Christina. I come from poor crazy people. My dad, despite 10 years of friction created in our household, continued to bring me computers because he saw something in me that nobody else could.I am resilient because of a turbulent family history, divorce, becoming a single mother and homelessness. Today, at the age of 33, I am paid to help multi-billion dollar companies architect strategies for their customers experiences.Statistically, I shouldn’t be here.Is to always be honest, choose the morale thing to do, treat everyone with dignity and respect, choose love and kindness first, and do not bring a single value from my family into my future life. Maintain boundaries, standards, expectations, and self respect.To fight like hell to get away from anyone who could send me back to my emotional and physical ghettos.But I didn’t get here on my own and I don’t deserve it more than other people. There were series of interventions in my life.A high school counselor who coached me and kept me from being short sighted. She taught me strategy.A kind neighbor across the street who let me hide at her house, work on arts and crafts, and who showered me with love. She taught me creativity and kindness.A high school computer teacher who let me use what I learned to re-architect the website and teach the class. He taught me my technical skills.A great friend who snuck a truck over to my house in the middle of the day and helped me pack my things and leave. He taught me to be a helper.Another great friend who let me move into his house, despite being under age, because he genuinely wanted a better life for me. He taught me not to expect anything in return.A strange man who hired me for my first web development job. He taught me that age isn’t relevant.A woman who gave me a job at a time when there were no jobs to give. She taught me we can sacrifice a little for ourselves to give others more.A man who gave me $300 so my daughter and I could eat. He taught me other people could see through facades.An ex-boyfriend who moved me cross country because he couldn’t stand to watch people be cruel to me any longer. He taught me that an act of generosity can change someone’s lifeA man who took a risk on a 30 year old agency nobody, because he believed she could. He taught me to pay it forward.Therapists, psychologists, and life coaches who helped me manage a lifetime of trauma, taught me what to expect from others, boundaries, and self respect… and that I deserve the best!Without helpers, I wouldn’t have made it out of emotional and physical ghettos. Against incredible odds, I am here. And for that, I am forever grateful.Both sides of our family were raised to be ashamed of their humanity. Nobody trusted each other, nobody wanted to be around, nobody respected each other.My family had so many secrets. As children, we we’re threatened to keep those secrets. It was regularly proclaimed that things were just the way they were and nothing would ever change.Do as I’ve done, the exact opposite of all of everything they had done. Refuse it, dispute it, and work against it. Never accept individual truths believed to be self-evident.Be honest, be kind, be transparent, be flexible, be wrong. This sits well with my soul.----Christina is a data-driven Solution Architect, Product Designer, and Researcher with an excellent track record in leading customer centric strategies.Christina Kay--Christina Kay--Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Christina Kay,https://medium.com/@atluxd,"13, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*BeC4ADNuUv9SP7hsu0B3SA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*trCokcZsW0iwkWnY1rSYCg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*aLvlu9E7wo2my6OnXQqn4Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mKUh1xDHTI0_J7UZXNttpA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*AKr-UsXfSZo1CxAiBBqRkg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VS-JfHB86mGPAtSY9NV0mg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*6MjhRWaaNAmNcF6OdC7dFA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*PnDwEBWjobNjsuBmQOO8Uw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*k6amJIUS5UJsWxBqvv7wfQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*koNNWK-SmT7ioKd7WHQtBw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*CMo9jg0_PUy6Mj_Ur_1A2Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*egEU0OVuaM4U4ka9vyCnGw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*GcWlNI-xW4fHY9J9_jo31g.png",12,7
253,22038,https://medium.com/@superimposeglobal/emoticash-response-1-834fca7e5516?source=tag_archive---------165-----------------------,EMOTICASH: RESPONSE #1,"“This re-humanises the concept, it breaks the cycle of consumption that may otherwise arise: buy goods, track emotions, make money, buy goods…”","SuperimposeFollow--ListenShareA main element of Emoticash, is that it involves data collection, which I think often makes people uncomfortable and raises concerns about privacy. It is common knowledge that simple interactions with technology and the internet produce data that is used in a commercial way, often with our permission but without our consideration. Does anyone ever really read the pages of text before checking the box next to ‘I have read the terms and conditions’? I would say that people are quick to moan about invasions of privacy, but when it comes down to it, most people don’t care enough to look into it or act upon it.In addition, A frequent rebuttal to fears concerning the increasing capabilities of AI is “AI will never be able to have the qualities of a sentient being, such as creative thinking or empathy.” However, the realisation that a machine can learn and comprehend the subtleties of human emotion through facial and vocal analysis, may appear only one step away from empathic AI. Especially if the machine can know whether reactions are genuine, or perhaps be able to recognise emotion more accurately than some humans. This concern and distrust many hinder how quickly Emoticash is taken up and utilised by consumers.For many, Emotions are something that feel intrinsically pure, natural and distinctly human. Therefore, making money off your emotions may translate into something dystopian and Black Mirror worthy. However, if our emotional data is going to be harvested anyway, why not profit from it? The fact that the funds earned via Emoticash can only be spent in an enriching an emotionally rewarding context is an interesting addition. As I think this re-humanises the concept, it breaks the cycle of consumption that may otherwise arise: buy goods, track emotions, make money, buy goods…When it comes to spending Emoticash, often the consumption of goods may not come from a very positive place, besides aesthetic or functional value. Increasingly people’s identities are tied up into their consumption habits and the goods they possess and present. The report mentions how digital has encouraged the curation of a “filtered and refined [life], extruding a mirage of perfection and fake emotions to the world, when the reality is far from glamorous.” This quote highlights how money is spent in order to attain the unattainable Insta-perfect life, or at least attempt to present it through the purchasing of goods. It is for this reason that I feel the decision to only allow Emoticash rewards to be spent on activities that encourage positive personal growth is a strong concept. Introspection, mindfulness and gratitude being activities that seek to increase the quality of an individual’s life without requiring the purchasing of material goods is one of its benefits.I think this is something that would be very well received considering current trends in health and wellness. The app Earthmiles track’s users steps (something people do anyway) and then monetise them, however the earnings can only be spend on goods and services in aid of health and fitness. Emoticash provided a similar service, using data that would be collected anyway, however providing the user with some benefit.DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLYServices Unknown is an open-ended Superimpose project that facilitates new ideas, discussion, events and product.Read The Emoticash Report here.Submission of new ideas to hello@superimpose.global----Superimpose is a new world creative agency challenging brands to go further.

Peki evimizde, arabamızda, yürüyüşlerimizde ya da spor salonunda bize eşlik eden müzik, duygularımızı nasıl etkiliyor? Bu konuda araştırma gerçekleştiren bilim adamları yapay zekadan yardım alıyor. Geliştirilen yapay zeka müziğin duygularımız üzerindeki etkisini inceliyor.Kuşkusuz hepimizin yaşantısına fon müziği olarak belirlediği şarkılar var ve bu şarkılar bizlere çeşitli duygular yaşatıyor. Bir grup araştırmacı da bu konuyu merak etti ve müziğin zihnimizi nasıl etkilediğini anlamak için makine öğrenmesini kullanmaya karar verdi. Bu doğrultuda bilim insanları tarafından yayımlanan yeni bir makale, müziğin fizyolojik etkilerini tersine çevirmenin mümkün olabileceğini de öne sürüyor.Güney Kaliforniya Üniversitesi’ndeki araştırmacılar tarafından hazırlanan makale, müzikte perde, ritim ve armoni gibi farklı faktörlerin farklı beyin aktivitelerini, fizyolojik reaksiyonları ve duyguları nasıl etkilediğine odaklanıyor. Makine öğrenmesinin bu tepkileri öğrenmek için kullanılabileceğini belirten bilim insanları, bu sayede müziğin insan üzerindeki etkisinin öngörülebileceği ileri sürülüyor. Bu araştırmanın nihai hedefi ise müzikal deneyimlerin mühendisliğini çıkarmak.Araştırmacılar kafa karıştırıcı değişkenlerin önlenebilmesi adına Spotify’da az dinlenen şarkıları araştırdı. Öncelikle insan denekler bir şarkı listesini üçe indirmek için kullanıldı. Bu üç şarkının ikisi dinleyicide hüzün duygusunu tetikleyen şarkılar, diğer bir şarkı ise mutluluğa teşvik eden bir şarkı olarak belirlendi. Şarkıları daha önce duymamış yüz katılımcıdan da bu şarkıları dinlemeleri istendi. Bu özel dinleti sırasında dinleyicilerin derileri üzerine nabız, ısı ve elektrik sensörleri takıldı. Bunun yanı sıra katılımcılardan duygu yoğunluklarını 0 ila 10 arasında derecelendirmeleri istendi.Araştırmacılar daha sonra ise elde ettikleri verileri çeşitli makine öğrenme algoritmalarıyla besledi. Örneğin, bir şarkının parlaklığının (orta ve yüksek frekanslarının seviyesiyle ölçülen) bir dinleyicinin kalp atış hızını ve beyin aktivitesini etkileyen güçlü göstergeler olduğunu öğrendiler. Bilim insanları bunun önemli bir başlangıç olabileceğini belirtiyor.Araştırma henüz erken aşamada fakat bilim insanları sonunda bir bireye özel olarak hazırlanan müzik tasarımlarının kullanabileceğine inanıyor. Bu gelişme müziği profesyonel olarak kullananlar için önemli olabilir. Örneğin izleyiciler üzerinde etki bırakabilmek adına film müzikleri seçen yönetmenler için oldukça faydalı olabilir. Ayrıca bu yöntemin zihinsel sağlık sorunları olan hastalara yardım etmek ve beyinlerinin belirli bölümlerini teşvik etmek için de kullanılabileceği konuşuluyor.Evet, yapay zeka müziğin duygularımız üzerindeki etkisini inceliyor.

260,45501,https://medium.com/@rajkhurmi/how-music-digestion-has-changed-over-generations-fcd52f17f39?source=tag_archive---------36-----------------------,How Music Consumption Has Changed Over Generations.,None,"Raj KhurmiFollow--ListenShareEver since streaming took over music consumption, it has been a weekly routine of my friends and myself to wait until midnight Thursday/Friday and save all the new music we are interested into our Apple Music or other streaming services. Usually, I would stay up and listen to all the music I saved however, the more streaming took over, the quicker my “Recently Added” playlist would fill up. Then around some time in Fall/Winter 2018 there was a stretch where over multiple weeks the number of album releases coming out was hitting double digits. There was no way I was going to listen to all of them in the single night, the math didn’t work out.This inspired me to look into how music digestion and the Shelf Life has changed over several generations. Generally, I will be using Hiphop music as the basis for my analysis and look into three different eras where listeners changed their listening behaviours. 1. The Physical Era, 2. The Mixtape/Gatekeeper Era, and 3. The Streaming Era. Within each of these eras I looked at how the labels tried to distribute the music, how consumers discover new music on a high level, and the marketing behind the music.The Physical EraProbably the longest running era of music digestion in history so far. This involved vinyl records, cassettes and cds. There were also other niche formats of music, but they all involved having a physical version of music that were played. This is the only era where the music business was associated with goods whereas the subsequent eras started presenting music as a service. Here the label had to put a lot of capital to have an artist record, manage the artist’s brand, and eventually manufacture the product and distribute it. “Back then the only way you hear feedback is in barbershops, at work, at school, local talk on the block, or on the radio” — Anthony Chase. This meant that there was a higher business risk with these artists. Then on the consumer side, because they were buying physical products, each album or song or extended play had their own unit value. The average or even the enthusiast consumer was not afforded the luxury to purchase multiple albums every week. Also, music was distributed on Tuesdays because album sales would have the total 7 days to chart and stores would open on Mondays to stock up for Tuesdays. All this led to the labels to back and market a very select group of artists. They would ensure they do all the press, and promo required to ensure they get a return on their investment. Labels would only cater and in a sense “groom” one artists at a time so that consumers could buy the album. They would keep an individual artist in rotation for as long as possible to provide consumers multiple opportunities to buy the music while it is still trendy. This then caused a difference in music digestion behaviours. Since there was a limited number of projects being released, the projects were in rotation longer and the exposure opportunities for the music was everywhere, consumers perceived the art much differently. Listeners were able to listen to the music within different settings, moods and have the music as situations in life progressed. This increased the emotional attachment to the music and there was constant effort in trying to dissect the music. This is why the music, especially hiphop music from the 90s had so much more impact towards the culture. It is amusing to think how music was sold as a trendy object and artist repertoire was held as a priority. In a way, the music was also more force fed because it was harder to escape it. The music to the casual market had less to do with personal taste and more with what’s popular.Mixtape EraJust like the name implies, the mixtape era was a part in music distribution history where the advent of mixtapes became popular. A mixtape for hiphop artists was a compilation of music that was not directly profitable and commercially sold but was used as a method for artist introduction or marketing the actual album. A big part of music digestion, especially for the enthusiast, is the process of artist discovery. Back in the physical era, unless you were heavily invested in the underground scene, a consumer would discover a new artist by either hearing a label pushed single, hearing them as a feature on a hit single by an established artist or as an opener from a show (the latter still relevant today). However, as the internet and peer to peer sharing services online were evolving, as mentioned in my article on Hiphop’s Usage of Social Media, the internet allowed for artists to reach the masses online. However, purchasing music as a product, the popular medium alongside physical sales. Itunes, like it or hate it, changed the game this era. Music finally saw its first major digital push at the incentive of being cheaper and more convenient to access. As exposure to artists and artist discovery made its transition to online medium, these same artists were now releasing free music. Usually this was in the form of hopping on someone else’s beat and having your own rendition to the music. These songs often used the instrumentals of well-known radio or contemporary records. These songs would often be rawer and more uncut, generally showcasing an MC’s skills. Now this changed how the labels pushed the music because they were now requesting artists to make music that was more marketable to a remix market and also request artists to remix other songs to promote the original song that would extend its lifecycle and also give another artist a spotlight. From the artist perspective, this was an investment on their end as there was no tangible return other than a non-quantifiable band image. So this changed how the artist approached their marketing to the fans as each album cycle on average would be associated with a mixtape(s) prior to drive up core audience engagement followed by the commercial album that would cater to the radio, clubs and the average consumer. This added, a deeper layer of music curation for the fans. The artist could leverage catering to the core because distributing music online was easier. A lot of artists have made their success or notoriety based on these mixtapes. Artists such as Lil Wayne, French Montana and Future made their introduction and cemented their position in the culture based on many successful mixtapes. Let’s also not forget that artists such as Drake, J Cole, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill, Tyler The Creator and Travis Scott all had their introductions into the rap world based on critically acclaimed and classic mixtapes that are considered essential works for people in out generation.So how does this translate into music digestion? Well this behaviour brought diversity into the distribution and variety of music. Now music was coming at a faster rate than ever before but only for those that were super enthusiasts. There was still a cost of admission to have a valid opinion on the music. Also, there was still a structure to the type of commercial success that an artist will have. So the consumer base was very divided. As a person who’s entry in the rap world was within this era, the amount of music was much more than that of the prior era but not over saturated because, home production technology was not as accessible at the time, it was emerging. Also, because the mixtapes were much more skill based and gave you the true form of a rapper, there was a higher level of artistic skill and dissection involved. For example, my favourite Lil Wayne project of all time is the mixtape No Ceilings, at the time I remember just freezing and not listening to anything but that for a solid 2 weeks. This was because hype at the time was focused and it was not worth for a different artist to try to saturate the market because all online suggestions was directed toward “gross traffic” where the more general likes from the mass community would put your project on the home page and shun another person’s mixtape. That’s why I said that the enthusiast had it easier but still had to put in work to find the other tapes. This was the popular trend until catered suggestion systems and streaming came around.Streaming EraThis leads us into the current and probably the “most f***** era of them all” as my friend loves to refer to it as. This era is the most unpredictable and has totally changed how we digest music and how songs get commercial success (that’s an article in itself). Having the ability to access anyone’s music on demand probably the biggest change in the history of music. Because of streaming, and home music production, the quantity of music coming out is faster rate than what a person is able to digest. This plus the fact that a song’s commercial success if blinded by micro, basically trivial statistics and charting for shorter periods of time, causes the flux of new music to put a stop to the enthusiast market as a whole but convert it to community or micro-enthusiasts. Essentially, artists now create their own communities online and within their fan bases. The consumer on the other hand has to define their music taste and focus on a sub-culture. To put an example to this, there are different classifications of a rap fan that doesn’t relate to a regional style of music. For example, one common example I have seen is the rise of fashion rap. As fashion and street wear culture has seen a boom, so has the artists backing these brands. So a sub-group of fans are more likely to listen and look to music that aligns with artists such as A$AP Rocky, Octavian, Gunna, Kanye, Playboi Carti etc. DISCLAIMER: I am not saying that a fashion head does not listen to other types of music. The argument is that artists are catering to other niche markets where they are more likely to get visibility. This also changes artist behaviour because they now do not have to worry about attaching themselves to the mainstream and make enormous amounts of money by attaching themselves to a particular group. This leads into the final point on how the algorithms have changed music dissection. In my opinion, these algorithms highly benefit the casual listener but are extremely disadvantageous to the enthusiast that does not know how to maneuver this technology. For the casual now, these recommendation systems are just going to assess your taste in music, aligns to a statistic and then recommends new music that you and people similar to you like. For the casual that are likely to listen to Top 40 tracks, it is a simple process. The problem comes with the enthusiast who has to trick the system by forcing themselves to listen to something out of their domain. Algorithms work based on the Law of Attraction. The user will get recommendations based on their current behaviour. So for example, if I am currently into Atlanta Trap music, I will only every get recommended new Atlanta Trap music and the only way to diversify is to do your research and go out there to add diversity into the system. This has changed the business because now labels and artists are making music to satisfy conditions of a computer code and may sacrifice their integrity. This has been prevalent in all eras, but it has been a bit more blatant now. To the contrary though, artists now are finding new and innovative ways to market their music which artistically attract new fans. I will be writing an extensive report on how the technology works because that is my field of education but for the purpose of this conversation, know that saturation is the name of the game. A person like me cannot digest all the music so sadly in the process, I’ve come the acknowledgment that certain music I will skip and if the artist is lucky, I will naturally come back to it. The only comment to artists I have is just make sure the quality of music is there. This fast food music era will naturally bring good art to the spotlight.Thank you for reading this opinion piece.

261,44727,https://medium.com/inside-the-salesforce-ecosystem/overcoming-failure-12d31ac9a924?source=tag_archive---------62-----------------------,Overcoming Failure,Stories and strategies from tech professionals for shifting the mindset,"Holly RushtonFollowAppExchange and the Salesforce Ecosystem--ListenShareCertain words have the power to immediately frame an emotion or feeling. Failure is one of those words, and it can carry a heavy meaning that leaves a lasting effect on a person.Now, consider a universal truth: everybody fails.“Failure is only the end if you decide to stop.” — Richard Branson, Founder at Virgin Media GroupMany of us have heard the go-to staple stories of “failure heroes”: Albert Einstein, from his struggles in school to selling insurance door to door before landing a job in a patent office (and later joining Astro and friends); Thomas Edison and his 10,000 iterations on the lightbulb; or Michael Jordan getting cut from his high school basketball team. These individuals, among countless others, demonstrate that failure is a normal part of life — the pathway to our goals.Working in tech means experiencing failure on a regular (and, sometimes, daily) basis. There’s always a new product issue to troubleshoot, a pilot that isn’t hitting the mark and needs reimagining, or an emerging industry trend to understand and dissect well enough to write about convincingly. I spent time talking with two of our partners—Adam Becker, Chief of Staff to the CRO at Conga and Julia Salem, Manager, Content Marketing at OwnBackup—about their outlook on failure, how they’ve experienced it, and, most importantly, what strategies they used to overcome failure.I was young and at a Midwest startup — a completely new space and field. I was trying to learn what it was like to be a digital marketer in 2005 or 2006 while committing to memory numerous TLAs (three-letter acronyms). Early on, while learning how to talk the talk, be confident, and simultaneously consuming the vast amounts of information being thrown at me on a daily basis, I was messing up and failing all over the place. When you’re a salesperson and you’re on the phone every single day, the reality is that the numbers are working against you. In the very best case, nine out of 10 times you’re going to fail on converting that phone call. Looking back at it now, I realize what a tremendous learning experience that time in my career was.Failing is healthy. I have two kids, and I told my daughter recently I would rather see them try and fail than not try at all. We are living in a time where the pace of innovation, both personally and professionally, is increasing. Part of keeping pace is you have to continue to try, and inevitably you will stumble. But if you don’t try at all, then that’s a complete failure.Within their roles — whether they’re a business development rep, a marketer, or an engineer — I highly encourage people to think about the things we complain about every single day. What’s keeping you from hitting your goals? What’s keeping you from achieving what you want to achieve, whether that’s today, this week, this year? It’s easy to find problems. What’s not so easy is to find solutions to those problems. In our team meetings every Friday, there’s a rule that you can’t talk about problems without having a solution to accompany it. Inspiring strategic thought and encouraging experimentation help our organization come together and overcome obstacles.Failure, to me, is always an option. Again, I embrace failure. I really do. There’s always something to be learned even if you think you did the absolute perfect job. If you don’t address the things you can do better, you’re not being honest with yourself, and you’re not going to improve.Dustin Sapp, former CEO of Octiv (acquired by Conga in 2018), was an incredible mentor to me. A serial entrepreneur, Dustin co-founded Octiv (originally named TinderBox) and wrote the first lines of code for the application itself. However, there came a time where Dustin had to make a choice to focus his efforts in other areas and allow new leadership to come in and grow the company. It’s tremendous to see that he had the wherewithal and the understanding to acknowledge that this business could do things that he was not capable of at the time. To no one’s surprise, he’s gone on to do great things, most recently being the COO at Formstack.I think that people everywhere view failure as black and white. There are all kinds of varieties of the way you fail. In fact, I fail every single day. I’m a lifelong learner, and I love to find new hobbies: I fly quadcopters, I’m into 3D printing right now, I do race car driving on the side, those types of things. But to learn any new skill and try anything new requires a learning process, including hobbies. Failure is a part of learning.My grand idea after college was to start a coffee shop where I’d be able to sell art and partner with other artists across Indiana. I looked at a space in a suburb of Indianapolis, put together a business plan, worked to get the idea funded, and found a coffee shop partner. Just as my wife and I were about to dive in, our location received an offer from a very popular global coffeehouse chain. Obviously, we lost our space. I was heartbroken, I felt like I failed. But eventually came to realize “this is just not meant for me.” It easily was the best possible outcome that could have happened in my career. It got me thinking “you need to learn a lot more about yourself. You need to start learning who you are, figuring out what you actually want to do.”In my grade school science class, I created a volcano and was so excited to demonstrate the interaction that occurs when baking soda is added to vinegar, water, and soap that I forgot to submit my experiment for approval before I could present it. The teacher explained the importance of paying attention to details and wouldn’t let me present my volcano. In fact, another student stole my thunder with the exact same approved experiment!When I was younger, everyone around me wanted me to be a perfectionist — it was a lot of pressure. I feared failure all the time. That caused me to miss deadlines. I would procrastinate on a project or keep second-guessing myself. Eventually, I realized you only live once. In life, you can’t always do everything perfectly the first time. You need to learn from failure and apply that new knowledge to your next obstacle.Whenever I experience failure, I often think of Winston Churchill’s famous quote, “Never, never, never give up.” Think about what the world would be like today if he and the allied forces gave up. Obviously, my personal challenges and failures are not nearly as monumental as World War II. Even so, I embrace my challenges head-on, and therefore I embrace failure. To never fail would mean I didn’t challenge myself to grow and succeed in my career or personal life.In my opinion, OwnBackup has become one of the most popular apps in the IT and Administration category on AppExchange because we embrace failure and learn from it. Every year we challenge ourselves to do more, do it faster, and do it better for our customers. Our belief that you should never lose data in the cloud drives us to constantly refine and improve our platform. Share some of your general strategies to overcoming failure. I always try to face my fears head-on. If I don’t succeed, I figure out what caused the failure and learn for the next time. I apply the same principles to my projects here. In fact, I learn more from pieces that gained little traction than those that were highly visited or downloaded. Those are opportunities for improvement. For example, a tweak to a blog title may change a flop to a success.The life lessons you can learn from failure are invaluable. I think those who have been most successful had the highest amounts of opportunities to learn from their failures.Fear is a metaphorical stumbling block because it’s better to have tried than never tried at all. If you put yourself out there, you may fail, but you could succeed. In hindsight, that failure will teach you a lesson that you can use later in life.Every failure is a learning toward success.This story originally appeared in the Spring 2019 issue of The Exchange.----AppExchange and the Salesforce EcosystemContent Marketer at @salesforce @appexchange.

263,42425,https://medium.com/@ODSC/model-interpretation-what-and-how-a08ac67d17c1?source=tag_archive---------71-----------------------,Model Interpretation: What and How?,None,"ODSC - Open Data ScienceFollow--ListenShareAs modern machine learning methods become more ubiquitous, increasing attention is being paid to understanding how these models work — model interpretation instead of just model use. Typically, these questions come in two sorts of flavors.In question 1, we are trying to get a general understanding of the mechanisms behind the model. For example, suppose we have an algorithm to predict the value of a house, which looks at a dozen or so factors. An “explanation” might be something along the lines of:[Related Article: Not Always a Black Box: Machine Learning Approaches For Model Explainability]“The primary factors are the square footage of the house and the wealth/income of the neighborhood at large. The condition of the house is also important. Other factors such as the number of bathrooms, size of the lot, and whether it has a garage are somewhat important. The rest of the variables have a relatively minor impact.”Often, people wish to make statements such as “variable X is more important than variable Y”. One caveat to statements such as these is that one needs to consider both the magnitude and the frequency of the impact. For example, imagine a world where half the houses have 2-car garages and half have -car garages, and 0.1% of the houses have luxury swimming pools. All else being equal, a house with a 2-car garage is worth $20,000 more than the 1-car garage counterpart, but a luxury swimming pool adds $150,000 to the value of the house.Which variable is more “important”? The swimming pool has a higher magnitude of impact, but a much lower frequency (more precisely, the variable corresponding to the swimming pool has lower entropy). There are any number of ways to combine the two factors into a single number, but you will always lose something significant in doing so.One way to get a feel for “how” a model is doing its reasoning, is to simply see how the predictions change and you change the inputs. Tools such as Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots precisely examine this. Here is an example of an ICE plot for how the year built of a house affects the model’s assessment of its sales price.Some care must be used when evaluating ICE plots, as they may take the model into an area in feature space where there is little data, and thus the predictions are unreliable. Still, they can be a useful tool in model understanding.In question 2, we are confronted with a prediction on a simple example and desire a “justification” for the conclusion of the model. Colloquially, we want to know “Why is that house so expensive?” (from the model’s point of view). The kinds of answers we are looking for are “It’s a 5,000 sq ft mansion!” or “It’s in downtown Manhattan!”.Beyond a simple reason, we might want something closer to what a real estate agent or professional appraiser might give. Typically, they may start with a baseline estimate, such as “The average house price in the U.S. is $225,000.” Then, from there they would highlight the aspects of this particular house that make it different from typical. “Your town is a bit more expensive than other towns, so that makes the house worth 50K more. This house is smaller than average in your town, which makes it worth 25K less. But it has a relatively large lot (compared to comparably sized homes in your town), which makes it worth 10K more. It’s slightly older, which makes it worth 7K less…” and so on.[Related Article: ML Operationalization: From What and Why? to How and Who?]As it happens, methods like SHAP, based on the Shapley value, can do almost exactly the same kind of analysis. XGBoost has integrated SHAP directly, making it possible to get these “prediction explanations” in just a few lines of code.Learn more during my session at ODSC West 2019!Connect with Brian here:Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianlucena/Personal Blog: http://numeristical.com/Github: https://github.com/numeristical/introspectiveOriginal post here.Read more data science articles on OpenDataScience.com, including tutorials and guides from beginner to advanced levels!

I would start another company, make a lot of money, then donate to people trying to tackle the issue.”There is definitely a part of me that considered his approach…TownSquare’s mission is to help us understand views different from our own. In a sense, we started TownSquare to help people empathize with one another and to demystify why people believe what they do.I wish there was a simple and clever way to do that, but we couldn't find one… The only way we could find was to write and build new algorithms and interview A LOT of people. It was hard like a math problem, but also hard like running a marathon.But… if I’m honest… the excitement of a complex and difficult issue that could defend its integrity financially, provide a means for people to be truly known and truly heard, is actually what drew me to starting TownSquare.I could ramble into a long spiel about my childhood now, but maybe one story is enough:When I was growing up I wasn't very good at speaking Korean nor was I very good at understanding the cultures of my multi-cultural friends. In 2008 when the financial crisis hit my family it hit us hard. And I saw first hand what happened when the risk of losing it all was apparent every day. Whenever there would be a fight in our house I would always wish that there would be a pause for clarity. I wished someone would try to clarify what the other person meant. But that never happened. When I tried to explain what was happening with my friends, I just didn't have the tools to communicate what was happening in our house.That kind of inability was crushing. And it was only through the patience and understanding of someone else that gave me confidence in my own voice.There was a story recently on TownSquare about Identity Politics. I got to watch this story with two friends who both view identity politics as something inherently negative in society. After watching a video that agreed with their perspective, they watched a video that challenged their perspective.One of my friends responded,“I like that video more.”“Why is that?” I asked.“Because those are children describing their experiences, and well, I’m a mom.”I guess there are a few times in life where moments of the past crystalize in the present. Where you see your past self, and can say to them, “I’m doing exactly what you needed.” I guess this was one of those moments.We started TownSquare to humanize the internet. To provide that understanding and patience for everyone.To be clear we don’t do this because we think this is an easy road but because it is an important one. And it is simply too important not to try.-Jeff----1Jeff Han--Jeff Han--Jeff Han--Jeff Han--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Jeff Han,https://medium.com/@jeff_53174,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*i3xhEELCs6rT0jh1HGoszQ.png",3,10

Your chair at the table suddenly becomes the Help Desk. You’re just trying to enjoy a meal but wind up answering questions about password strength between forkfuls of food.Here are some tips to help alleviate the stress of being forced to be “on” when you really just want to be in a food coma.(1) Be polite! Remember, tech and security are often scary subjects to people not in our industry. We don’t want to scare people away from good practices. You may be the only Information Security professional your family comes in contact with. As I talked about in my DerbyCon 2019 talk, “Empathy as a Service to Create a Culture of Security ,” you need to try to be approachable and listen to what people are really asking. So, where does politeness come into play? If pressed upon to explain SIM jacking to Uncle Irv during the first course of dinner, ask to delay the conversation until after dessert. “That’s a great question and surely a big problem, Uncle Irv, but I’d really like to enjoy this meal and not think about work. How about we gather around after dessert, and I can explain some of the points to you?” You know your family dynamics, but it stands to reason that most polite requests for a deferment in the conversation should be respected. Your mileage may vary. It’s inevitable that you’ll have to do some “shop talk.” So, just negotiate it to be on your own terms.(2) Be prepared! There are so many helpful Information Security resources out there, that have already done the work for you. Here are some links that you can send to your inquisitive family members, or in some cases, there are tip sheets that you can actually print out and distribute them if asked about security. Sure, that seems a little weird. But, it’s easy and you don’t even have to answer questions. Just hand out some material and announce that you would like to hack into Aunt Mary Pat’s Sea Foam Salad.(3) Be a translator! If you’re not into football, someone talking about a “pick 6” or a “PAT” or “muffed punt” sounds like Charlie Brown’s teacher to you. The same goes for people who aren’t tech or security savvy when you start throwing around industry terms or jargon. Do your best to explain things in easy to understand terms, or at the very minimum, define the jargon you’ve used. You may be trying hard to give InfoSec advice, but if you’re using terms that your listeners don’t understand, then all your hard work falls upon deaf ears. Instead of, “We really DDoS’d that turkey!” maybe say something like, “We really attacked that cooked turkey from all sides, didn’t we?!” Use familiar words and common examples to explain InfoSec terminology and scenarios. Bonus reading, “How to Talk to Anyone.”(4) Be patient! Some time, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, you too were a n00b at all this stuff. Have some patience and understanding for your family members who may not embrace all these concepts of tech or security as easily or with as much interest as you do. If your Cousin Brenda scoffs at the thought of a password manager because it seems to difficult and maybe even stupid to her, her reaction may be because she’s scared or confused or not understanding it. Use the force of InfoSec inside you to be patient with the people around you.(5) Be fun! Lastly, have some fun with this through Bingo! I created an InfoSec Thanksgiving Bingo card with a bunch of terms that you might hear mentioned or asked of you during dinner. This is a mobile version of the card, but you can also create your own card here. Feel free to yell out “BINGO” during dinner, even if it’s only funny to you!In summary:Be polite!Be prepared!Be a translator!Be patient!Be fun!Have a peaceful and relaxed Thanksgiving holiday!----#Librarian turned #InformationSecurity professional.

Finance officers have to keep embracing new technologies in the workplace to increase efficiency as well as visibility, which, in turn, result in substantial quick wins in all responsibilities undertaken by finance chiefs and their teams.As of 2018, 25% percent of finance executives have already leveraged automated tools for forecasting and budgeting. In 2019, 42% of the finance officers had adopted the technologies signifying a 17% revenue increase. The trend is expected to continue given that 90% of respondents (working at firms with over $100 million revenue) said that they intend to leverage these tools in the future.With that said, let’s cover the actual technologies that finance executives need for success.Jeff Thomson, a CFO insight writer, in an article on Forbes, said that “ Finance will become increasingly dependent on automation and analytics to deliver real-time, clear, actionable and forward-looking insights.”Therefore, soon, dealing with uncertainty and volatility will become a norm for the finance sector. As such, there is a need for finance function transformation to ensure companies become more effective at obtaining forward-looking insights from data while monitoring new information and incorporating it into financial models. With data analytics tools, finance officers can utilize big data platforms via machine learning to analyze big sets of information. Thus, they can make detailed predictions on an array of issues, for example, how a specific asset is expected to behave on a balance sheet.Apart from that, data analytics also allows finance officers to combine both unstructured and structured data, for example, web monitoring and social media, to determine questionable activities, trends, and patterns, hence allowing for the mitigation of potential risks such as cyber-attacks and fraud.With such benefits to gain, more and more finance officers are embracing digital analytics in their operations. A recent survey found that 23% of finance officers consider enhancing data and analytics functions to transform risk management, comprehension of value drivers, and forecasting to be their top priority.By embracing CFO digital transformation, finance executives will be able to leverage the power of robotic process automation. Shifting to RPA will result in success in the workplace by enabling finance officers to accomplish the following easily:But even as finance officers use robots, it is essential to note that human involvement needs to be maintained.Here is another technology that finance executives need to pay attention to as far as digital transformation and the finance function go in hand. With cloud technology, finance officers can steer organizational success by accessing data in real-time and implementing collaborative working.SaaS too will foster digital finance transformation. When used in combination with cloud technology, businesses stand to benefit from greater flexibility, reduced costs, and more streamlined operations.The roles of AI cannot be ignored in the digitalization in finance. These systems can take instructions and information, learn from human behavior, and tackle questions or situations in a human-like manner.AI also complements RPA and other technologies, thus transforming the various functions of finance officers. Artifice intelligence applications can be trained to analyzed tax regulations, absorb new rules as they are launched, offer useful advice, and respond to various queries.Even though nowadays, AI plays an essential role in finance in a digital world, there still will be a need for human insight and experience. Loren Williams, a Chief Data Scientist, notes that “…but with big, important and complex decisions, you may see AI systems providing advice or recommendations to help the human decision-maker, and back up those recommendations based on its ability to gather, ingest and make sense of vast amounts of structured and unstructured data.”Blockchain is yet another vital technology in CFO digital transformation. It can help finance executives steer success by:It is noteworthy to comment that new technologies are going to replace old practices for good. As such, it makes total sense for finance teams to implement and take advantage of these and other technologies in their operations.

A Sony tem mostrado que apesar das polêmicas dos remasters, deixou seus melhores exclusivos para o fim da geração para colocar o seu console na história.Os jogos exclusivos são uma carta na manga das empresas para vender mais para os entusiastas e fãs de determinadas série de jogos como Gears of War ou Uncharted, por exemplo. Desde o início dessa geração a Sony investiu pesado em exclusivos, mas esse alto investimento precisaria ter resultados. Porém, o resultado que a Sony queria não era apenas monetário, mas ser o melhor console da geração e para isso necessitaria de uma estratégia.Desde seu lançamento em 2013 até o ano passado nenhum jogo exclusivo de PS4 ganhou o título de melhor jogo do ano (Game of The Year — GOTY). God of War (GoW) foi o primeiro título exclusivo da Sony a levar o prêmio mesmo enfrentando adversários de peso como Red Dead Redemption 2. O GOTY veio bem a calhar já que o jogo demorou cerca de 5 anos de desenvolvimento, ou seja, basicamente desde a estreia do console.De certa forma, Death Stranding segue os mesmos passos que GoW. A pressão de faturar o prêmio neste ano recai sobre lendário Hideo Kojima, que já ganhou o prêmio de ícone da indústria. Seria uma volta triunfante do criador da série Metal Gear, mas para isso ele concorrerá contra Cyberpunk: 2077 (dos produtores de The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, GOTY'15) e Sekiro: Shadow Dies Twice (dos criadores de Dark Souls).Em 2020, o exclusivo The Last of Us: Part II já vem como favorito a GOTY para repetir o feito do primeiro jogo e acabar por fechar essa geração de consoles com chave de ouro. A estratégia da Sony de lançamentos para os últimos anos do PS4 fica clara: três grandes exclusivos, três jogos AAA, três GOTYs, a santíssima trindade e assim colocar seu console na história dos clássicos.----Graduando de Ciência da Computação pela UFRGS e apaixonado pela influência da tecnologia na sociedade.Jobe Diego Dylbas dos Santos--1Jobe Diego Dylbas dos Santos--Jobe Diego Dylbas dos Santos--Jobe Diego Dylbas dos Santos--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Jobe Diego Dylbas dos Santos,https://medium.com/,0,2,79
272,20883,https://medium.com/@seanblack/are-real-estate-agents-a-dying-breed-ccb3ccbff6fd?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,Are real estate agents a dying breed? (The short answer is “Yes!”),None,"Sean BlackFollow--6ListenShareAn abbreviated version of this article originally appeared on ForbesThink about it: You can go to any developed country in the world and buy the same cup of coffee at Starbucks for $4 or the same BigMac from McDonald’s for $5, but you cannot use the same real estate agent twice in two years to buy or sell a $300,000 house and have the same experience! Why? Because real estate agents are independent contractors doing their job…well, independently.While agents are often affiliated with brands like Coldwell Banker, Century 21 or Keller Williams, they are NOT employees of those brands, so those brands cannot dictate how their agents do their job and therefore control the consumer experience. In fact, most of these brands aren’t even in the real estate business; they are in the franchise business. The franchisor’s customer is the real estate broker (aka the franchisee) and the broker’s customer is the real estate agent, not the consumer. Yes, the broker has a fiduciary responsibility to the consumer, but the consumer experience, relationship and transaction are owned by the agent. So basically, real estate agents have total discretion over how your home is bought and/or sold, and no two agents do their job the same, and most agents don’t do their job the same way twice. The median annual salary of a real estate agent is $45,990, so agents have little in the way of capital, technology or other resources required to make the purchase and sale of your home predictable, convenient, transparent or cost effective. Confused? You aren’t alone! This arcane, inefficient structure is the way residential real estate has been done for the past 50-plus years, but all of that has started to change in a big way.We are in the early innings of what I call the “institutionalization of home buying and selling.” Unlike the last wave of real estate innovation pioneered by the likes of Zillow and Trulia (in full transparency, I was a founding team member of Trulia), this wave of transformation is not being powered by companies that have real estate agents as paying customers. Instead, this wave of transformation is being powered by technology companies cutting out middlemen to work directly with consumers in order to dramatically simplify and streamline some or all of the process of home buying and selling. Whether you are trading-in your old house for a new one with us at Knock.com or selling your house off-market to modern-day home flippers known as iBuyers, in five to 10 years consumers will likely be buying and selling homes to and from companies, not through agents. In just the last three to four years, the first wave of these disruptive companies have raised billions of dollars to build technology platforms that increasingly transform the complex and laborious functions of the home transaction performed by agents into a more seamless, certain and transparent experience.To understand how this wave of innovation and its impact on real estate agents is different from the last, let’s take a quick history lesson on how the first few waves haven’t changed much of how things are done.The first wave of real estate “innovation” began in 1996 and involved little more than moving home listings online from the MLS and newspapers. That year, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) licensed Realtor.com to private company HomeStore to launch a public website displaying property listings. In 1997, Realtor.com became the exclusive online real estate listing source for several consumer media outlets like USA Today and AOL, making it the largest website for real estate listings. But, as the name Realtor.com implies, NAR’s primary customer is the real estate agent, not the homebuyer or seller. In a failed attempt to appease its real estate agent customers and keep them relevant to the home buying and selling experience, NAR restricted Homestore from displaying critical information on Realtor.com, including past and recently sold homes used to determine home prices.By 2005, tech investors started to stir again and it became obvious to a few of us entrepreneurs that the exorbitant fees and information thiefdoms plaguing the home buying and selling experience were exactly what the internet was supposed to fix.Trulia launched in October 2005 as the first independent home search engine, basically “Google for Real Estate.” We went directly to brokers and agents to get their listings on Trulia.com to avoid the information restrictions NAR placed on Realtor.com. By doing so, we were able to democratize the information buyers need to make the biggest purchase of their lives, and traffic to Trulia.com soared. Not only did we show homes for sale and recently sold homes, but we also liberated tons of other information like crime statistics, school data and average commute times. We used maps to help people visualize local boundaries and heat maps to show price and search trends down to the neighborhood level.In early 2006, Zillow launched the Zestimate, giving consumers home price estimates instantly without talking to a real estate agent for the first time ever, and traffic to Zillow also soared. A year or so later Zillow added homes for sale like Trulia.In just a few short years, consumer traffic on Trulia and Zillow surpassed that of Realtor.com. In 2010, Zillow went public on NASDAQ and in 2012 Trulia went public on the NYSE. In 2014 Trulia and Zillow merged, valuing Trulia at $3.5 billion. That same year, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation bought Realtor.com for $950 million and turned it around into the second largest consumer real estate site, valued at $2.5 billion by Morgan Stanley in 2016. Today, homebuyers visit Trulia and Zillow a combined 216 million times a month and Realtor.com another 76 million times each month. This is astounding considering there are only six million homes bought in the US each year! In 2005, homebuyers were at the mercy of real estate agents for the most basic information. 13 years later, homebuyers are fully empowered with all the information they could ever want or need to make the biggest purchase of their lives.Unfortunately, home sellers did NOT benefit from this last wave of innovation at all. The process of selling a home is every bit as expensive, laborious, opaque, stressful and uncertain now as it was then. In 2005, the typical 6% commission paid to agents by sellers totaled $60 billion annually. In 2018, that same 6% commission is well over $80 billion annually thanks to home price appreciation and a million more homes purchased every year. And yet, home sellers still endure the same three to four months of nail biting stress and uncertainty to sell their new home. The only thing that changed for sellers during Real Estate Web 2.0 is that buyers now find their home listings on Trulia and Zillow instead AOL or Yahoo! Real Estate. In fact, sellers are now at a disadvantage to buyers, since buyers have a great deal more information about and transparency into the buying process than sellers have about the home selling process.Ironically, the very companies that empowered buyers with all the information they need to make their biggest purchase with less reliance on agents became increasingly dependent on those very real estate agents for survival. Real estate agents pay these sites billions of dollars every year to advertise themselves in and around home listings. You cannot change an industry selling stuff to its players that enables them to continue doing things the same old way and extracting the same high fees. Enter the third wave of innovation.By aggregating hundreds of millions of homebuyers on just a few websites, the Web 2.0 innovators enabled the next generation of innovators to focus on revolutionizing the home selling process. But many among this wave of innovators are not just tech companies; they are also licensed as brokers performing some or all of the transaction, replacing or repurposing real estate agents in the process with data science, technology and access to billions of dollars in capital to create liquidity in residential real estate for consumers for the first time.So what role, if any, does a real estate agent play in a world of tech companies offering on-demand certainty, convenience and transparency, and a stress-free Home Trade-In or Instant Offer? Well, the bad news is that it’s hard to imagine agents competing against the revolutionary value these companies bring to bear given agents’ limited resources as independent contractors. Unfortunately, the brands with which these agents are affiliated are no better positioned to compete with the newest wave of innovators. As discussed, most brands are in the franchise business, not the real estate business. They have no control over the user experience, given their customer is the broker, the broker’s customer is the agent and the agent’s customer is the homebuyer and seller. There are literally three degrees of separation between most real estate brands and the consumer. The reason Starbucks and McDonald’s can provide a predictable, repeatable experience and quality product is that they own every part of their value chain.The good news for agents is that a real estate license is still legally required for some parts of the home buying and selling experience, like making and negotiating offers on homes. So real estate agents have the opportunity to be part of the next wave by becoming expert negotiators. Best of all, they have an opportunity to be paid a salary and benefits like any other professional, such as they do here at Knock, instead of living commission check to commission check. However, this opportunity will likely only be available to a small percent of the estimated two million licensed agents in the US; as Paul Boomsma, President of Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, said at Inman’s 2019 Disconnect event, “the number of agents in the U.S. will likely drop by at least a third in the future. At the upper end…agent ranks could be winnowed by as much as 70%.” So they had better hone their negotiation skills if they want to be one of the few to survive. It will likely take at least five years for the transition to be complete, so they have some time — or do they?----6Co-Founder & CEO @Knock.com, Founding Team @TruliaSean Black--Sean Black--Sean Black--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Sean Black,https://medium.com/,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*MjxNhzBTf9coynaIAb2wsw.jpeg",10,77

However, not all coffee is the same and not every store or cafe that provides coffee operates the same way; and that is what we are going to explore more of today. Today’s blog will be talking about Five’21 Roasters; a Calgary-based coffee company that roasts and sells coffee using an online store. I will be talking about the humble origins of the company, how it operates, and what types of tools they use to conduct their business. The information used in this blog are based on an interview I conducted with Carina Huggins, is the digital content strategist and business strategist.Five’21 Roasters has a very interesting story; Carina told me that the entire business was based around a shared love of coffee between her and her husband. Initially, it started as spending a lot of money on coffee; a result stemming from the birth of their first child. Between 2016–2017, her husband Trevor would buy and roast his own coffee beans in their oven. Eventually, he invested in a Mill City coffee roaster and started roasting coffee in their basement as a hobby. His crew at the firehall would try it and provide feedback; and as the coffee got better, they eventually started buying it from him. After spending so much time roasting on that Mill City roaster, Trevor decided to invest in a San Francisco Roasting machine and got serious about pursuing coffee roasting as a business. They built out an approved roasting facility in their garage,with a number of firefighters bringing in their trades to help build the facility; it was a team effort.Their name also has an interesting origin: Trevor and his dad are tall people, about 6'9. Whenever someone would ask what their height is, they’d jokingly say that they are 5 feet and 21 inches, and they’d watch as the person asking would calculate that out in their head. During the For McMurray fires, his dad was medically evacuated home from a holliday while Trevor was fighting the fires; it was a difficult time in their lives, and Trevor returned home to take his father off of life support. He decided to name the company in his honour; after that inside joke that the two of them had, remembering that it’s important to have a sense of humor no matter how tough life gets. They created the logo to honour the team effort and contributions that firefighters made in the creation of the company.Since starting in September last year, Five’21 Roasters has steadily grown in the last few months. Given that it is a company that is still in its infancy; it operations aren’t going to be as expansive or as complex as other companies in the industry that have had more time to grow and expand their business. However, it is still very interesting to look at how a small business such as this would operate in this type of industry; from purchasing the coffee beans to delivering them to the consumers, to what goes on behind the scenes.Five’21 Roasters purchases their coffee from a supplier based in Vancouver. Carina noted that Trevor and their supplier connect roughly every 2–3 months, and their supplier is very knowledgeable and provides them with a lot of great advice regarding the quality of harvests and which regions are currently experience great yields. Carina also mentioned that they try look for beans that emphasize a social and environmental responsibility in their creation; for example, the Rwandan beans that they offer originate from an area of the country where the profits from the washing station are redirected back into the community through social projects: such as a school that is built and directly funded by the staff.Five’21 Roasters’ selection certainly has fan favourites, and while they do their best to keep their main selection in supply; they also however, do their best to also bring in new and unique selections as a way of setting themselves apart from the competition.As mentioned before, Trevor invested in a San Francisco Roasting machine when they got serious about pursuing this as a business; and so he uses this machine to roast the coffee beans in his free time. As a firefighter, the way his schedule is set up allows him to have the free time to roast, bag and deliver coffee to not only customers that order it through their website, but also to the other places they supply to. Currently; they have set it up so that individual consumers purchase coffee from their Shopify website, then they select whether they want it delivered on Monday or Thursday, then Trevor delivers it door to door in person. They also supply wholesale coffee to a couple outlets within the province; some notable examples are: MobSquad Cafe and Homegrown AB (Airdrie).One key part of their business is their podcast. Titled Five21 Shift, it was initially started as a way to deepen their mission and purpose within their business; as Carina puts it: “help others thrive instead of survive in their lives”. Trevor is a huge advocate of first responder mental health and he has seen the effects the career can have on people if they do not live intentionally. They bring in guests who have extraordinary careers while facing challenges, and over time their guests have become more diverse. For example, one guest was a woman who had metastatic breast cancer and lives her life three months at a time, while another guest was the first Canadian to scale Everest without oxygen. By bringing in others who have overcome great challenges by living their lives with a purpose, they hope they can encourage others to do the same.On the business side, Carina brings her digital strategist expertise to their online presence, which is predominantly their Instagram account, blog, Facebook page, website and podcast. She also handles anything related to their online store (Shopify — more on that in a bit) and their blog. While Trevor handles the roasting, sales, delivery and customer service. They also hired external help from Upwork to help them do things like taxes (again, more on Upwork later), and use artificial intelligence (Kit for Shopify) to help manage analytics and customer service.Now that we have an idea to how the company operates, let us look at some of the tools they have used in their business. Since they are not a very large company, they do not use a wide range of tools that they use to operate their business. And while they have used software such as Microsoft Excel and online services such as Dropbox and MailChimp in the past; the majority of their business is centered around their online store that is hosted by Shopify, their social media precense through their Instagram account and the external freelance help they recieve on Upwork; so I will focus on talking about what these services are and how Five’21 Roasters uses these.Shopify is an E-commerce platform that has plenty of utility and flexibility for new businesses. It offer store functionality; users can design an online store that fits their product, there are “shopping cart” functionalities that coordinates with payment and delivery, it also has customer service functionality where you can handle things like refunds and order fulfilment. It also has inventory management services, website hosting and mobile app support that can be really beneficial to new businesses that are looking to head into product retail. An example can be seen bellow:Five’21 Roasters uses this service heavily. Carina told me that Trevor uses this service constantly for the business; he not only uses it to track inventory, but also uses it to monitor sales and it suggests emails to send to their customers using some of the plugins that Shopify offers, such as Kit. Carina also hosts her blog on their website that Shopify hosts.Instagram is also a very critical service that they use. Instagram is a social media website that allows users to post pictures for other people to see. If a user is interested in seeing more content from a person or company or topic of interest, they can “follow” that account and they will see more of that user’s content appear in their news feed. They can also look up other pages to see other photos that a user has posted.As the social media manager, digital content strategist and Instagram expert, Carina uses Instagram to achive different goals. For example, they make posts that educate their customers on the different types coffee bean crops and the types of beans they sell. She also uses Instagram from a branding perspective; she shares elements of Trevor’s first responder lifestyle that fits with Five’21’s mission statement to build their identity as a company. But they also make posts that other people relate to; posting the occasional meme or posting about topics or quotes that they think their followers will react to in the pursuit of an intentional life.Upwork is an online service that connects entrepreneurs with freelancers who they can hire to complete projects in many different fields that the entrepreneurs otherwise couldn’t themselves. You start by posting your job, then Upwork recommends to you freelancers based on their skills then you can decide who to hire for your project. You’re able to send and recieve files through the website, share feedback in real time and pay for only work that you authorize on the project. Five’21 Roasters uses this service to find someone who can work on their receipt organization and excel spreadsheets, which makes life easier if you want to save time or don’t know much of the tax code.Five’21 Roasters was a company that was a lot of fun to cover. I could just tell from the way that Carina talked about their business that both her and Trevor are very passionate not only about coffee, but also with providing others with possibly the best local coffee that they could provide and their mission is to help people thrive instead of survive by intentionally planning the day with a cup of coffee in hand. And as a consumer, I feel that it really makes it easier to gravitate towards a product or a service when you see the owners show real passion and love for the product or service that they are trying to sell. If you’re in to coffee I highly suggest checking out the link to their website that i provided in this article.I was also very unsurprised with the number of tools that their business used. As I said before, Five’21 Roasters is a small company that started very recently; so the fact that the business rotates around three tools is something that I almost expected. However, learning more about how they utilized the tools offered by Shopify, how they use Instagram to shape their online identity, and how they make their lives easier by using services like Upwork leaves me to think that they picked the best possible tools given where they are in their businesses life cycle. Shopify is very simple to use and offers a lot of very useful features for entrepreneurs to use if you put in sufficient time to get used to using the platform, while Instagram is so popular and so widely used that it would be puzzling if someone started a company and didn’t use the platform and Upwork allows them to be connected with people they can hire to help them with tasks so that they don’t have to do it themselves.That’s everything from me! I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it. Again, I highly suggest checking out their website and Instagram page if you’re interested in trying out their coffee.----Entrepreneurship Technology Class BlogConnor HendersoninEntrepreneurship Technology Class Blog--Shanty KamalinEntrepreneurship Technology Class Blog--martin ndeinEntrepreneurship Technology Class Blog--Justin WilliamsinEntrepreneurship Technology Class Blog--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Raj Boongaling,https://medium.com/@rb27345,"6, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*7UQ0sQIK3WKnqMuLCfAlmg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*czTFVNaysFQEMB-q-Eurzg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VWbkrAHtrkjWw8GR6fr9Kw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-KXpBefH3vqLujonLrWlSw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*92l3LFPGOGuzq6DmE2jdMw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JiiZyQbAhIuFUzkN14A_bQ.png",9,0

Another article about how phones are evil.” as you roll your eyes. While that is sort of what this article is, I’ll preface it by saying, I like my phone. Phones are great. The modern cell phone is a device that has reshaped the world, in some ways faster than we can keep up with. But what I also like in the devices I own, is a purpose, a desire or need to be filled or fixed. I have no need for a smart speaker. This probably pegs me as an old man, but I don’t mind going to a store or looking something up with my fingers on the aforementioned phone I like. I have no need then for a tiny box listening in all the time just in case I need toilet paper. It is a solution to a problem I don’t have.The thing about smart speakers or cell phones or voice remotes, etc, that is supposedly attractive to the consumer is that they do a lot of different things. Take the cell phone, which I can speak to better since I have owned a few of them. It can make calls, send texts, take photos or video, surf the web (as I’m sure all the youths still say), stream music and movies, control my lights or thermostat, play video games and, hell, I can even write or edit things I’ve written (like this article) on it. It’s a magic miracle rectangle in my pocket. But does it do any of those things well? Does doing a lot of things add up to something valuable?My phone can take some high-quality photos but it doesn’t have the control you get with a Nikon or Canon. It can record audio but if you’re making a record you might want to go with a few SM57s jacked into a Tascam at the very least. I love a quick castle defense or match three game but when I’m really looking to get into a virtual story, I’m booting up a console or my PC. And as for writing, phones are fine for texting but no one is writing the great American novel with just with their thumbs.Let’s focus on a device that does just one of the things my phone can do, my iPod Classic. Well, I say iPod Classic when I should say Classics since one of them is full so I had to get a second. For those of you uninitiated, the iPod Classic was the original iPod from Apple. It was a little black, silver or white box with a small two-inch screen and a revolutionary for the time click wheel. It had a mind-boggling 160GB of storage and almost all of it was dedicated to one thing, music. It was simple. You just put as much music as you could into iTunes and plugged it in. A few minutes later it was all there, ready to scroll through at your leisure, stored in your pocket.The iPod was made for music nerds like me. It could hold my whole library, arrange and sort it any way you could want, simple and clean UI and most importantly offered a distraction-free music listening experience. It wasn’t without flaws. The 30-pin connection gets filled with junk easily, iTunes itself has a lot of trouble with anything more complicated than one record by one artist and who knows why they never put in a hard drive that didn’t spin. Instead, they just discontinued it a few years ago. I was obviously devastated. Now if my iPods give out, which with a spinning hard drive one solid bump or fall will do the trick and all I will have left is my phone for all my portable music listening needs.So how does my phone stack up when it comes to listening to music? Well, I have a Galaxy S9 Edge and it comes with two music apps, one from Sprint and one from Google. Both are part of that group of apps that come with a phone that no one really wants and, if they can, usually uninstall them. Bloatware I think it’s called. The offering from Sprint is especially bloated with the landing page set to the store where you can buy songs, bundles and ringback tones. Remember those from the dawn of the cell phone? You’d pick a song you would want to blast at anyone who dared to call you, friend, family and potential employer alike. If I had music on my phone, I would only be able to find it in this app through a few menus but the main focus is to get the end user to spend money. Most of this goes for the Google Play app as well, which I have used in the past when my iPod was broken. But along with all the previously mentioned problems, it also will lose songs as they disappear from the service, ruining the flow of records and playlist. Google is more subtle with their store but only because it will play ads between songs. I don’t know about you but nothing throws off my groove like a Squarespace ad.Of course, ads are also a problem on other streaming services like Spotify or Youtube but those will disappear once you subscribe for a certain amount a month. So for five bucks plus your phone bill, you can stream as much music as your data plan will allow as long as you have a connection. Essentially, you end up paying $100+ just to listen to some music that you don’t even own (owning media v. renting access to it is a whole other article for another day). Now compare that to just having high-quality audio on a hard drive in your pocket that just works, distraction-free for one price. Which of these devices is going to enhance your music listening experience?I am in no way saying the iPod is a perfect machine. If it were still around today I could think of a few things I’d change. First, you obviously put in a solid state drive with as much memory as you can fit in that small package. Swap out the old connector for something more modern. Since it’s Apple, it’ll be their proprietary USB-C garbage but still, it’s less space for dirt and junk to build up in. Add some wireless sync in there and while you’re at it, if you really have to, add a WiFi connection for anyone who has to have Spotify, or in this case, Apple Music. All the things I would add in this imaginary re-imagining of my iPod though would be serving one purpose, to make listening to music a better experience. Your phones only goal is to keep you on your phone for as long as possible and that is the one thing it does that very well.Most applications on a phone are only surface deep. The music app is made to get you to buy a few songs or stream whatever the company post on the landing page. Your camera is mostly used to take quick snapshots or clips and post them to some social media platform. The screens aren’t really the IMAX experience and the microphone is barely able to make calls. The thing is, that is fine for most people. But if you’re looking for a deeper and frankly more enjoyable experience, you’re going to eventually need the right tools for the job. Filmmakers and photographers need a camera that is dedicated to being the kind of camera they need. Recording artist of all kinds need a device with its sole purpose being capturing audio or being an instrument. The last thing you need while laying down a beat is your mother calling in the middle of it. Even things like drawing and painting, even when done digitally, are best left to programs and tools that were brought into this world specifically for people who draw and paint. It’s more expensive and has a learning curve but I feel that, in the end, it’s needed. It all just depends on your needs. If a phone can get you by, that’s great but in the end, you need the right tools for the job.Aside from your specific needs, having a device that is made for one thing is all around a nicer time. A dedicated device, as opposed to your phone, offers a distraction-free ordeal. No notifications, texts, calls, emails or ads. When I listen to a record, the only interruptions I have are the ones I allow. When you’re at a movie, there’s a reason they want you to turn off your phone. It is a place and medium designed to use most of your senses to capture all of your attention, which is required to properly enjoy the movie. The same goes for any other media you might want to consume or create. It deserves your full undivided attention.So while my phone is a miracle box that allows me to do many different things, sometimes you just have to focus in and have a gadget made that only does one thing. Every photo I take doesn’t have to be for Instagram and every song I listen to doesn’t need to be counted and logged. Everything I tap doesn’t need to be recorded and used to sell me more things. My iPod may not let me shoot video or tweet or even stream music, but it does offer a designated place more all my music right in my pocket and it does it well. I’ll take that any day.----Just an average weirdo with some thoughts.Jason Bombach--Jason Bombach--Jason Bombach--Jason Bombach--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alex Mathers--227Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Jason Bombach,https://medium.com/@TheCurmudgeon,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*SXv5Gtis_hc4zyDaInXd5A.jpeg",7,2

The event took place at the CENTQUATRE with an astonishing scenery conceived by Jeannette Boulanger, the event and experience director of the summit. The power of deep tech inspired perspectives mixed with creative staging helps the public (corporate, startup founders, investors and PhD students) get immersed in what could revolutionize tomorrow, deep tech wise and clearly contributes to the signature of the event. Here are some highlights of this tech for good summit I wanted to share with you.To contextualize this sharing of experience, it is interesting to start with the deep tech’s definition, business wise, given in the new BostonConsultingGroup – Hello Tomorrow study (The Dawn of the Deep Tech Ecosystem) : “Technologies (which) can have a big impact, take a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and require a significant amount of capital to develop and scale.”One of the questions raised was how Europe can learn from the American model and foster deep tech innovation. Markus Larsson, Vice President @PARC, gave part of the answer reminding us of the 3 pillars which certainly accounted for the rise and dominance of Silicon Valley on the innovation and tech scene :“celebration of failure, celebration of crazy ambition and at a federal level having agencies trying to fund hard technical problems without seeking commercial returns on the short term”.The creation of an ecosystem in which innovators can develop their project, access funding and scale up is decisive. However, Europe still is a hard market to tackle mainly because of its fragmentation, a weakness that counts when you have to face behemoth competitors such as the US and China.What struck me this time was the will to promote wise and sound use of the power of innovation and diversity in deep tech. For that matter, Xavier Duportet, in his introductory speech at the event’s kickoff party, stressed the fact that what mattered today was not only to focus on tech innovations but on “how we use tech for the good”.Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State for Digital, asked the question: “how to build a sustainable future?”, stating that of course technology is part of the answer but also that the voices of innovators have to be heard and attract the people from across the world.The Code of the Wild — Are we entering a genomic revolution ? panel was quite insightful, for that matter. Josiah Zayner — one of the leaders of the biohacker movement who has been experimenting on his own genes — questioned the class distortion effect which prevents some people from accessing therapeutic solutions saying :«The future is already here. It is just not evenly distributed. »Mobility, environment, healthcare, data and AI, quantum computing were some of the topics showcased in the 2019 edition of the summit. It is interesting to see the issues today’s society has to address through the prism of innovation. Raul Bravo @Dibotics listed the problems autonomous car companies had to face in order to enhance the environment’s perception and prevent inappropriate responses from the vehicles that can induce lethal accidents. Improving sensor’s capacity and the processing of data so as to give self-driving cars “super human reflexes” is one of the missions of Dibotics.Anita Sengupta, CPO of Airspace Experience Technologies, had the audience reflect on Mars exploration and the challenges of re-creating a viable environment in a space ecosystem. Speaking of recreating a viable environment in space mirrors the actual problems our consumer society generated such as pollution, waste of resources. Romain Troublé, CEO of Tara Expeditions, with his keynote “getting intimate with our oceans”, highlighted the need to raise general public awareness on the crucial part oceans play in climate change and they role as “Life Support System” for humanity.Sarah Pedroza, co-managing director of the summit, shared the now acknowledged fact that there is “still work for tech to solve the gender and inequalities gaps. Technology is challenging us as societies to define which world we want to imagine.” And, clearly, having only men imagine a world for the next generations of women and men is not an optimal solution to consider.Joanna Bryson, Reader (Associate Professor) at University of Bath, with her Artificial Intelligence and Human Accountability keynote, underlined that “AI trained on human language replicates our implicit biased reality”, taking the example of the 2017 article written by Caliskan, Bryson & Narayanan on occupation-gender association. This is the society’s responsibility (governments/enforcement, corporations/accountability, citizens/consumer choice) to grow awareness on and tackle the underlying moral challenges brought about by technological innovations.As a conclusion, I will leave you with a few words by Gemma Milne, co-founder of the platform @Science: Disrupt and host for this 2019 edition of the Hello Tomorrow Global Summit about hype and idealism in science and technology :“hype is needed as well as idealism but we need to be asking the hard questions and put hype and idealism into context”.----Marylene Ricci--Marylene Ricci--Marylene Ricci--Marylene Ricci--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Marylene Ricci,https://medium.com/@marylene.ricci,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*x2Ls_2aYIdBfMuYDr-yiog.jpeg",4,40

If the control program uses COM port, you can install the Windows driver to add Real/Virtual COM ports.You can find the jetport web manager in production connected to the internet without authentication and default configuration .https://www.zoomeye.org/searchResult?q=%22jetport%22%20%2B%22web%22There is a telnet port , ssh access and web server, the point here is that usually in many ICS communication devices the web sever is often full of vulnerabilities, this is another example about how easy is to inject javascript persistent code in the device web application , this a really common issue in all ICS devices probably because there is no basic security procedures , or probably security hasn’t been taken seriously at the development stage .So, if you play around with the web application there are some string values that can be modified, let’s see if i can inject special characters.In “Port Configuration” there is an option to modify the port alias name , what if we try to inject javscript code in there?Seems like works as expected , nothing complicated at this point, the problem is that the value or our injection is going to be stored in persistent way, that’s cool, the problem here is that there is no proper sanitized input in the web application causing the special character injection easy to spot and inject.Click on submit, now our payload is going to be stored and executed in browser each time someone open the web application and visits the port configuration setup.There are several problems , situations, conditions , directions decisions and issues underlying each problem found in modern ICS devices, they offer you availability , remote monitoring and accessibility but the lack of security is clear in every new finding.The END----Computer/Network security researcher@bertinjoseb--4@bertinjoseb--@bertinjoseb--1@bertinjoseb--Graham ZemelinThe Gray Area--ProviesecinInfoSec Write-ups--nynan--4Ally Petitt--9Owen McCarthy--2Dewanand Vishal--1HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",@bertinjoseb,https://medium.com/@bertinjoseb,"8, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*b5wexgXkc_Dk4BYjbqeveQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*TNuOiKxEs4epWvEMdfwQIA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jqpnVMKcL1_w3MKLwLJ6vg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*QugEK9WL_rbF-FHqGX2SWQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*p4mq9ERwDP-NFee3cZ_k2w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*gCK-MWuXj8QwsmNQGrwXLw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JoL4HE6d6SilY_cp629lfw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*W4cB6mZCTA6ftkOYu1adsQ.png",3,10
285,52695,https://medium.com/the-digital-condition/week-2-cognition-in-high-frequency-trading-47fffc23b288?source=tag_archive---------171-----------------------#72d8,Week 2: ,None,"Milan StürmerFollowThe Digital Condition--1ListenShareAudio introduction to this weeks discussion here.Last week, we began our reading group on The Digital Condition with a text that made no reference to digital technology. Perhaps it was inevitable that in the ensuing discussions the question of (and call for) examples kept coming up. This weeks reading, Cognition in High-Frequency Trading: The Costs of Consciousness and the Limits of Automation by Armin Beverungen and Ann-Christina Lange, explicitly presents itself as dealing with High-Frequency Trading (HFT) as an »exemplary case for the study of algorithmic cultures« (pg 2, also here). There is a lot of exciting literature on what exactly an example is and does out there, but this is not the place to go down this particular rabbit hole. Suffice it to say what everyone engaging with theory already knows: examples (as distinct from applications) are always trouble and vehemently refuse to play the illustrative role assigned to them in Christian Wolff’s fable of enlightened rationality.In Beverungen and Lange’s paper, HFT functions as an example not once, but twice: HFT is an example of algorithmic culture and we can investigate questions of affect, cognition and automation accordingly. But HFT serves also as an example of an example, precisely because HFT is already a well-established »illustrative example« (5) and presented as »emblematic« (2) of these issues. They write:»As media and cultural studies more broadly engage with how the computational media that surround us constitute a ‘technological unconscious’, and how algorithms condition our lives and cultures, HFT is often presented as emblematic both of fully automated computational systems and of affective contagious dynamics that mark these systems. Key here is the assumption that algorithmic HFT, working at speeds below the threshold of human perception, escapes the cognitive capacities of human traders, so that affective dynamics mark both the human-machine but also the machine-machine relations, as in the case of the flash crash. In this paper, we want to contribute to this literature with a more nuanced account of affective contagion, cognition and automation in HFT.« (2–3)So HFT is not only an incredibly exciting case study by itself, it also reveals a lot about contemporary media and cultural theory, the way it deals with ›examples,‹ and its assumptions regarding the technological unconscious. It is particularly for this reason that I have decided to add this paper to the syllabus for an interdisciplinary reading group, because it introduces a whole range of current debates while simultaneously pointing to crucial shortcomings. For those not familiar with the field, I want to stress that Beverungen and Lange don’t construct weird strawmen or dig out obscure takes on our contemporary condition, but genuinely stick to approaches well-known in media and cultural theory. In this short introduction to this week’s reading I want to highlight three brief points where the example of HFT helps us to engage in more careful theorizing. In doing so, I am effectively only highlighting half of the paper. While it contributes to both, »the social studies of finance through a close engagement with media and cultural theory concerned with the technological unconscious and cognition, and to media and cultural theory through a more thorough empirical encounter with the phenomenon of HFT« (3), I am predominantly stressing the latter aspect for this reading group.Yet, as the first aspect is nevertheless of particularly interest to my own thinking, I want to briefly remark on the relevance of the former point. Recently, especially since the financial crisis of 2007–2008, there has been a spike in interest in the »dialogue between the research of media and the research of capitalism« which, at least in the German context, is arguably rather unusual. In various places the question is raised what media theory — as media theory — can bring to the table in such a dialogue. In addition to calling for a more nuanced account of affective contagion, cognition and automation, the paper offers a quite convincing interface for facilitating such a dialogue. Particularly thinking about the automatisms of capital from a media theoretical point of view might be an incredibly productive approach, both historically and critically. With this in mind, let me now return to the empirical encounter with HFT and its implication for media and cultural theory.Algorithms in HFT are clearly not like a hammer that you pick up because it would be quite painful to hit the nail with your palm. Granted, in this new scene playing out on the trading floor the human no longer seems to be the sole protagonist, carrier of all meaning just as she carries the hammer. Yet, while it might seem »fair to say that media technologically-armed financial markets constitute machine-machine ecologies in which human traders play an increasingly marginal role« (2), the paper vividly highlights how »central humans remain even to HFT« (16). In fact, the paper is structured around a variety of strategies and processes by which humans still remain in the picture — and not just accidentally — even within »the complex ecology of the financial markets« (12). This is not only due to the various strategies of establishing cognition (8–12) and the limits of automation (12–17), but also because HF traders are »actively partaking in the construction of the computational environments and cognitive systems in which they engage« (3).While the image of the completely passive consumer (the one known mainly for helplessly watching TV programmes) has largely been dispelled from the media-theoretical debates, the image of the user interacting with this strange and increasingly complex technology-thing has taken its place as the epitome of the human figure in a technological ensemble (and perhaps gives the image of the consumer a second, rebranded life). But, as they show, when dealing with HF traders, the idea of ›consumers‹/›users‹ proves wholly insufficient.Beyond questions of the relative centrality/marginality of human participation, to me the paper also — on a more general level — points to other ways of conceiving participation in an event beyond the swinging of a hammer. As one of the interviewed traders remarks: »It’s an incredible amount of responsibility I bear« (15). The modes of participation might change, but that does not necessarily imply a complete absence.A lot of the recent obsession with questions of microtemporality comes from the fact that — as they point out with reference to N. Katherine Hayles — »consciousness is slow relative to perception« (5). It’s predominantly an argument about speed, particularly about speed relative to human capabilities. Yet, what begins as an argument about speed with reference to the human is often dropped in consequent arguments and we end up with some fundamentally other, non-human temporality, beyond (or rather, below) all access to human cognition. It gets theorized in terms of affect, contagion and the inhuman. With HFT, however, we can think about this more carefully, without denying that there still is something worth considering here:»humans are too slow in acting in markets, and their cognitive capacities by themselves are too limited for comprehending financial markets. … Certainly HFT takes place in milliseconds, and therefore in the cognitive gap. Yet this does not necessarily mean that HFT takes place outside of human control and comprehension. As we will outline below, our empirical research suggests that humans precisely devise algorithms as cognizers supporting their cognitive capacities for comprehending the market« (8–9)Thinking about various modes of awareness and — crucially — the labour that goes into establishing forms of comprehension, cognition, and control, might be a useful approach that gets away from an ontologizing discourse about different temporalities (see esp. 10).In this short introduction to the week’s reading, I have focussed on HFT’s status as an example of an example for techno-ecological thinking, and how Beverungen and Lange’s paper complicates this. To end, I finally want to return to the question of HFT as an exemplary case. Last week, we briefly talked about the scenes from which a theory is generalized. Is our thinking on technology and sense shaped by a scene of a human holding a hammer and doing things with it? Is it based on the experience of making a compromise with the materials when weaving a basket, the complex transfers of work/energy when moulding a brick, the production and distribution of the free software movement or the adaptive interaction when riding a horse? What is the exemplary case for a techno-ecology? Maybe HFT is a contender. It sure fits all the hallmarks of techno-ecological thinking. But it is so clearly a political, economic and institutional scene, inextricably part of the history of the »automatisms of capital« (17) and the »financial markets as cognitive systems« (3), that it might spare us from the eternal recurrence familiar from any seminar and reading group: Somebody makes an argument ›about technology,‹ somebody interjects that ›Yes, but also economics/politics/institutions!‹, everyone — rightly! — nods and agrees, because, of course also those things, and we move on to the next argument about technology. If we keep HFT as an exemplary scene in the back of our mind, maybe the question of technology presents itself differently.----1The Digital ConditionResearcher @MedialeTeilhabe, Institute of Culture and Aesthetics of Digital Media (ICAM)@Leuphana_Uni looking at debt and technology for his PhD.

How Skill-based Certifications Can Brace Up the Next Gen IT Professionals,🔑The big takeaways: -,"Albert ChristopherFollow--ListenShareIn 2022, one in five workers will have AI as their coworker, says a Gartner report. We’re living in an upending work of artificial intelligence. Multiple organizations start using intelligent technologies in their product development. People with skill redundancy may soon find themselves in unchartered waters.Ever since AI evolved, there has been an advancement in the development of human society, with dramatic changes taking shape in the form of theories and techniques.However, with such an accelerating pace AI faces today, is artificial intelligence well understood by all?In an era of the interdisciplinary science of mathematical logic, computer science, linguistics, cybernetics, and automation, multiple questions have been raised about the concept of AI. During the 1940s and 1950s, multiple scientists from varied fields such as engineering, computer science, and mathematics already made an exploration regarding the possibilities of artificial brains: the possibilities of defining the intelligence of the machine.In simple terms, the aim of artificial intelligence majorly focuses on augmenting the efficiency of mankind in the way they work. The way they govern society through intelligent machines, and where people and machines could coexist and work harmoniously.Fast-forward to 2030, expert analysts expect people to become more dependent on networked artificial intelligence in a complex digital system.Some predictions say,· There will be a continuation of the historic arc of transforming our lives with positive results as we continue to use networked tools available.· Others say the dependence on these AI and related systems is likely to increase.Is there a possibility that by 2030, the advancement in AI and other related technology systems will have the capability of enhancing human capacity and empower them as well?Despite the fear of AI and automation taking over millions of jobs, brainpower will still be a necessity. The human race, after all, is not on the scrap head. At least, not for the moment.Undoubtedly, there seems to be no shortage of artificial intelligence being at the limelight.Despite the fear that instills today, AI will create double the jobs than it destroys.Based on a canvassing that was done in the summer of 2018 regarding how people were likely to accept the fact of AI enhancing human capacities. These were the responses received,· 63% of the respondents said they were hopeful about how people will be better off by 2030· And 37% denied the fact stating AI and its related technology systems will reduce human autonomy to such an extent where people will still not be better off than they are today.Thought leaders concluded stating human reliability in AI and technology system is possible only if people are well connected with the way these tools, technologies, and networks function.Skill-based certifications are a stepping stone that draws jobs one step closer to AI professionals such as AI experts and AI specialists.Skill development is widely considered a major factor, while regretting education has not given its due diligence in improving technology skill rate, especially in newer technologies like AI, data science, machine learning, and big data.In this connection, online learning programs and AI certifications are certain skill development measures that are widely considered as critical aspects of job creation.AI certifications act as evidence of earning professional credibility.With newer technologies on the rise, it gets challenging for employers to find the right fit. In addition to this, potential employers usually prefer candidates having AI skills. Artificial intelligence is slowly taking on the IT world, acquiring skills through 🔗AI certifications could do wonders for your career.👉Newer and unconventional career paths — AI is expected to generate 2.3 million jobs by 2020, says Gartner. Also, a report by Capgemini mentioned around 83% of companies that are using AI said this will be the next technology that will lead to the creation of newer job roles. Hence, the need for certified AI professionals will rise exponentially.👉 Demand for certified professionals in AI will continue to rise — Around 2.3 million jobs to be created by 2020. How can you make use of this career opportunity? Taking up a certification program will boost your AI career as compared to the non-certified individuals. 🔗 AI experts will undoubtedly rev up.👉Earn fat paychecks — Multiple top tech companies are investing huge compensation on candidates with the latest AI skills. An AI certification is an add-on advantage, a pathway to enhancing your earning potential.👉 Higher employability rate — If you’re looking to penetrate the AI industry, earning a credible AI certification is perhaps the wisest thing for an individual to do today. Not only will you possess the latest skill in the industry but it will also convince potential employers that you’re the perfect candidate for their organization.“That population is going to need to upskill, reskill or change jobs fast,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings.What’s your excuse today?----AI Researcher, Writer, Tech Geek.

290,36157,https://medium.com/liv-up-inside-the-kitchen/looking-at-retention-lifetime-value-with-data-science-1fc884e6a4ad?source=tag_archive---------29-----------------------,Looking at retention & lifetime value with data science,Probability to Buy Again,"Yuiti AraFollowLiv Up — Inside the Kitchen--ListenShareIn this post, we will present a little bit about the Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial (BG/NBD) model and the Gamma-Gamma model, simple but very useful Bayesian models that we have used here at Liv Up to evaluate retention and lifetime value of our customers.Customer retention and customer lifetime value are both very important metrics for any e-commerce to evaluate the past relationship with its customers. With these, we can answer important questions such as:However, in some cases it would be very useful if we could look at these metrics in the future, then we would be able to answer a bit more interesting questions such as:So the context in which we are working is the following:We will have customers with histories of purchases and would like to know how the future timeline would look like in terms of purchases. From this scenario we are going to focus on the following historic information from each customer:Now we break the modeling problem in three questions:For the first question, the model will try to answer the opposite, how likely it is for a customer to never buy again. It will assume that after every purchase, a customer will have a probability p to not return and that this event will happen following a Geometric distribution on each day following the purchase. In order to model the variance between different customers, the model uses a Beta distribution. With that we will have a Beta-Geometric distribution, that is part of the BG/NBD model.Now for the second question, what we could say about the number of purchases a customer would make in a given period? For that, the model assumes that each user will have a natural purchase rate, and it uses a Poisson distribution to model this behavior. For a given time period, some customers will have a higher purchase rate and some will have a lower one. To capture this variance between different purchase rates, a Gamma distribution is used. The combination of these distributions, a Gamma mixture of Poisson distributions, is also known as a “Negative Binomial distribution”, which makes the second half of the BG/NBD model.Finally for the third question, how much can we expect him to spend? For that, we will have a Gamma distribution to model the purchase average value for each customer. To capture the variance in the distribution of value spending among each customer we will have another Gamma distribution. As a result, we have our Gamma-Gamma model. One caveat is that this model will assume independence between the number of purchases and their values, which may or may not be the case depending on the context.For practical use here at Liv Up we use the lifetimes’ package, an awesome python implementation for both models by Cameron Davidson-Pilon. Below you can check a few interesting ways you can use the results from the models.The blue line is the probability to be “alive” (buy again) for an individual customer for each day, while the dashed red lines are actual purchases made. We can see how the model adapts differently based on the customer history, for a slow buyer his probability takes more time to really decrease, while for a fast buyer it decreases really fast.Here we sorted all the customers by their predicted lifetime value (from lower to higher), then we break into chunks of percentile groups. Now we can check how much each group contributes to our overall revenue. This is interesting information when we want to understand more about our different groups of customers.Today we use the predicted probability to rebuy and lifetime value in several Liv Up areas.Our business growth is driven by retention. We need to know whether our new products and new features are helping us achieve the objective of retaining customers. However, it is hard to define when a customer is active or inactive and the model provides a data-driven approach to this problem. Using the probability to rebuy, we define for each repurchase, if the customer was retained or resurrected.Retention takes time to measure. We are a 3 years old company and we can’t wait 12 months to measure retention. So with our model we can have an indicator with a drastically reduced observation period.Based on the probability to rebuy, we segment our customers to deliver a personalized campaign based on their engagement. Combined with the predicted lifetime value, we can send a more efficient message, which helps in optimizing ROI on retention campaigns.In this post, we gave a very brief overview of the BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma models. We have mostly focused on the overall intuition, but if you are still curious you can find the complete details from the original authors here and here. The official documentation for the lifetimes’ package is also a great resource, and you can quickly run the models on your data. The package also offers useful methods for plotting & evaluating model performance.The BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma models, and also the lifetimes’ package, have been very useful here at Liv Up, and we think it might be as useful for any business that wants to understand the relationship with its customers.----Liv Up — Inside the KitchenData Scientist at LegitiYuiti ArainLegiti--Luiz ArakakiinLiv Up — Inside the Kitchen--4Luiz ArakakiinLiv Up — Inside the Kitchen--1Rê MoreirainLiv Up — Inside the Kitchen--2Tasos PardalisinRoad to Full Stack Data Science--Leonie MonigattiinTowards Data Science--13Unbecoming--767Deepak Chopra | Talking Data ScienceinTowards Data Science--Minha HwanginTowards Data Science--3Andrejs SkļarevskisinGoogle Sheets Geeks--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Yuiti Ara,https://medium.com/@yuiti,"8, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hVvt5duowg4_c9NdHO0kHw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*WdRbpuU-pwk-eUtuXE41aA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*saqcoxIU4_RcGa11LcaKNA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*caPx00-qwsQ42FTWcGCN0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*h-Pz-qYrIQzqxWhA4TQ94w.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8MDjTeawKj_aYx7NPEUxOg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*csoF49QM3_5Kyh8Vk4yySg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*d-_LUh1tKhQCnyudCwbqmA.png",6,234

These stages ultimately become more complex and rigid the more mature the design becomes, due to the oversight needed and the number of contributors involved. This growing complexity often leads engineering teams to reassess their internal processes and seek out better tools to help manage these workflows.Among the more important workflow adjustments to be made is in how a team manages their product data. As discussed in “3 signs that you’re ready to move your BOM from a spreadsheet to a PLM tool”, some early-phase companies opt to manage product data through spreadsheets. However, this can become problematic really quickly, especially when you’re coordinating across a large team scattered in different locations or on different work schedules. At a certain point, a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software solution is crucial to ensure companies don’t face development crises or manufacturing errors and delays.So let’s say you’ve made the decision to begin utilizing a PLM software solution. What now? What do you actually need out of a PLM software solution when you’re transitioning from a spreadsheet system or are simply just beginning to track revisions and changes being made across the product data files? Below we’ve enumerated the core features of a PLM software solution that you need when you’re just getting started.Perhaps most critical is the ability to manage your Bill of Materials (BOM) in a centralized repository. Yes, you can manage your BOM within a spreadsheet during the early phases of your development process, but a centralized PLM software solution will become critical when you start managing input from a variety of disparate parties. These may include engineering team members, external suppliers, vendors, contract manufacturers and partners, all of whom could potentially be contributing to decisions made to your Bill of Materials. No one really wants to be the bottleneck managing a set of spreadsheets and no one wants to deal with the anxiety of accidentally overwriting correct information or entering data incorrectly. Let your PLM software take the burden off your shoulders and manage it for you and your team.Additionally, a truly centralized BOM management system alleviates the concern over where to go to get information and how to be sure it’s the latest version. Teams, early on, often find themselves managing product data spread between one or more spreadsheets, a file hosting service like Dropbox or Google Drive, and the personal desktops of team members. This usually leads to team members wasting time hunting down the latest product files because it’s not clear where the most recent information is, who owns it, or if it’s even complete.Revision management of your design files and manufacturing specifications, is best done in a centralized, secure and controlled platform such as a PLM software tool. PLM software excels at tracking changes, identifying different revisions and leaving an audit trail of who changed what, when, and why — which is invaluable when something goes wrong and you’re frantically trying to figure out what happened. The centralized nature of a PLM platform allows teams to operate efficiently with the confidence that all efforts are tracked, managed and shared across teams in one place that can be quickly referenced at any point in the design process.Change management that isn’t centralized often results in excessive overhead to chase down approvals, and necessitates distractive emails to find change details or double check with team members that you have the latest information. This understandably broken system quickly leads to wasted efforts, miscommunications and lost time. With centralized change management everyone can rest easy that the team is collectively referencing a single source of truth, with no critical conversations buried in private emails.Beyond managing product design files, PLM software provides great value for managing sourcing and supply chain data, during both prototyping and mass production. The highest variabilities in any hardware product are the price and lead times of your components. As you need to make sourcing changes to account for this, PLM software makes it easy to track these changes and empower your procurement team to make purchasing decisions most efficiently. The obvious benefits of such a system are cost and time savings, both of which can dramatically impact the success of your business. There are countless stories of teams being surprised by unchecked component lead times or price jumps that occur for a variety of reasons that are difficult to forecast. A centralized mechanism for tracking component cost and lead times is invaluable for teams trying to get their product(s) to market as fast and as cost effectively as possible.As you can see, centralization is a critical component of the key features that you’ll want to look for in a PLM software tool. BOM management, change management and component sourcing can ultimately be done in a variety of ways across a number of different tools and platforms. However, as explained above, managing data in a less than centralized way will always become a problem that’s hard to fix. Naturally, fixing the problem requires a move to a more mature workflow. The logical conclusion is that since you are going to face this problem and will subsequently transition to a centralized system, why not begin utilizing a PLM software tool as early as possible?Furthermore, a lack of centralization or even a delay in implementing a centralized data management program can put your business at risk. Hardware development is an unforgiving pursuit. Slight miscommunications, erroneous data or undocumented testing can trip up even the best companies at any point along the path to production. The Samsung Galaxy Note7 fire fiasco comes to mind when thinking of the potential consequences of a broken data management system. In this high profile instance design errors were left unchecked as suppliers moved forward with an ill-fitting battery design. A tighter more centralized data or information management system surely would have helped avoid this situation. And if this can happen to Samsung it can certainly happen to any organization. So don’t let this or anything similar happen to your company.Originally published at www.durolabs.co.----Duro LabsCo-founder @durolabs, SpaceX alum, Northwestern WildcatKellan O'ConnorinDuro Labs--Kellan O'ConnorinDuro Labs--Kellan O'ConnorinDuro Labs--Kellan O'ConnorinDuro Labs--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Kellan O'Connor,https://medium.com/@kellanoconnor,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fV8go_SyxyIJVTU6J6gEtw.jpeg",5,0

Its Epson Printer Support services are accessible by all Epson users all around the world in different forms — over-the-phone, via online chat, as well as assistance in-person. These modes can be availed by people based upon their preference, but the level of support from any of these stays the same.Most common issues that people usually face with their printer devices are listed as below:Printer jamming issueUnable to detect PrinterLow Toner IssueUnable to power on printerPrint quality issuePrinter not responding at timesThere is also the availability of online support modules that also are accessible to all. These modules contain step-by-step instructions about resolving every printer issue and also understand about the internal printer hierarchy to try and identify the root cause by oneself. These modules are pretty much informative, though the language used in citing the steps is very much technical. When a printer’s warranty expires, it is only these support modules that are left as the only official means to get Epson technical help. This can leave a person with no technical understanding and also in a dire need to use his/her printer in a state of agony, thereby making him/her look for alternative means to get support.In order to get assistance with Epson printer troubleshooting in such a position, there are a couple of effective alternate means as well. The first among those means is the assistance of a tech professional that lives around and has quite an expertise dealing with all kinds of printers. Because he holds an expertise over the same, his fee is usually quite high, but other than official support services from the OEM his assistance is the next best alternative to get support service for your printer.Alternatively, if your issue does not require services such as Epson printer repair, or those that do not require hardware troubleshooting to the very core, over-the-phone support services are another popular means to get assistance. Quite many companies are existent today that provide live on-call or on-chat support service in return for a fixed sum of fee. This fee, though, varies for different firms, and so a couple of comparisons must always be run among them before finalizing the firm to avail support services from.These comparisons include assessing online reviews for your chosen firms, and determine the one that has the best credibility among all. Doing price comparison in terms of support packages and the features included within them is also a good means. Whichever firm you choose, always refrain from the ones with poor track record, because it’s likely that you will not be able to get assistance from them the way you would always intend for. Like Call-PC-Expert has many skilled technicians with huge experience who can give you’re a proper solution and resolve your all queries with ease.----Router Help Support (routerhelpsupport)--Router Help Support (routerhelpsupport)--Router Help Support (routerhelpsupport)--Router Help Support (routerhelpsupport)--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Router Help Support (routerhelpsupport),https://medium.com/@jacksparow15091994,0,3,0

You can read Part 1 here.When thinking about project management methodologies, we often confuse whether we go for Scrum or choose Kanban for our project. It is better to know the main differences first. You can choose one or you can use both and get most of the benefits from them. Let’s discuss some of the key differences between Scrum and Kanban.Some teams are getting the best of both worlds by combining techniques from scrum and Kanban, by using either Scrumban or their own unique methodology. A comparison of Scrum and Kanban shows that they are similar in many ways. Both embrace and are derived from the principles of lean and agile project management. Both support early and frequent delivery, self-organized teams, continuous improvement, high quality, and the prioritizing of requirements based on business value.Scrum tells you how to work while Kanban tells you how you’re working. by Paul KlippHere are some major differences between Scrum and Kanban:Both Scrum and Kanban are agile methodologies but Scrum follows a process framework and provides detailed rules, roles and responsibilities. Kanban, on the other hand, is a change management method, doesn’t describe specific set of roles, responsibilities and process steps. It starts with incremental and evolutionary changes to the system.In Scrum, a product backlog is created and is prioritized based on customer feedback. Items in the backlog are then pushed to fixed set of iterations called sprint using strict set of roles and responsibilities. In Kanban, tasks to be done are divided into visual workflow states like To-Do, In-Progress and Done and each of the workflow states has a maximum items threshold that can exist at any point in time, in each of the columns.Scrum is based on embracing change and continuous improvement by allowing customer feedback in every sprint. Kanban is emphasized on Getting-Things-Done (GTD) basis, i.e. How many tasks of the project are done and how many are pending?In Scrum, the project is divided into smaller chunks called sprints, tasks are pushed from customer or product owner to the backlog and team pulls the tasks from backlog to sprint with a strict rule of commitment. Whereas, Kanban is based on WIP (work in progress) limit, i.e. maximum limit that can exist in a column to get things done.Scrum main artifacts are product backlog, user stories, burn-down chart, timeboxing and sprint backlog, while artifacts of Kanban comprise of just a visual board view which have specific workflow states like To-Do, In-Progress and Done etc.Scrum emphasizes on various roles and responsibilities to take over the project, which include Scrum Master, Product Owner, Product Customer and Scrum Team. On the other hand, Kanban starts with existing roles and the main focus in Kanban is to stimulate continuous, incremental and evolutionary changes to the system.In Scrum, each item in the sprint is estimated and further divided into task for granularity. In Kanban, team creates a fixed size item and doesn’t require to divide into sub-tasks or sub-items. Estimating is optional in Kanban.The biggest difference between Scrum and Kanban is that one is a development framework, and the other is an improvement strategy. Scrum is most useful when a new team is starting on a project. It tells them what to do and how to do it. A Scrum team that starts using Kanban visualization is still a Scrum team. They are just using Kanban to improve how they do Scrum. Kanban allows a good infinite velocity that seems less affected by period in the scrum, day of the week and other peoples’ vacation schedules. On the other hand, Scrum relies more on consistency in the team and hence, it is immensely organized and collaborative.In our next post of the agile project management series, we will discuss on how to choose the best project management tool/software that fits our needs perfectly and what factors are important to look for.----Technopreneur, Millennial, Expert Generalist, Game Producer, XR and CG EnthusiastAsad SohailinNerd For Tech--2Asad Sohail--Asad Sohail--Asad Sohail--David TheilinBootcamp--2David TheilinSerious Scrum--3Chris Daily--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alex Mathers--227Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Asad Sohail,https://medium.com/@masads,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FgC4q7x4F1HyFaJh49oyrQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zW7SbGxt2r9t9j8Du7VPiA.jpeg",4,115

More on unpaid projects later, but first, I’ll tell you a bit about paid contracting gigs.My first contract was with Google because my best friend worked there. We had gone to school together and she knew I was a strong writer, so she hired me to write some case studies for her team. I’d interview some customers, figure out their pain points and challenges, and write about how Google for Education products fixed their problems. Challenge, solution, outcomes, impact. It was pretty formulaic and a far cry from writing a PhD dissertation. Beyond being incredibly grateful for a paycheck, I took the job because being able to say you’ve worked with Google here associates you with a premium brand. I got pretty adept at writing case studies very quickly and was asked to teach classes for different marketing offices at Google on how to interview people and develop case studies. I even ended up writing an instruction manual with a case study template that I’d created.If you’re going to break into tech, you need someone who believes you’re smart and is willing take a chance on you. Some might call this chance a lucky break. If you need a lucky break, let’s discuss on Twitter.You’re only going to get a lucky break if you expose yourself to luck repeatedly. If someone gives you a chance to work with a well-known brand, take it. Bootstrapping off an existing brand is one of the quickest way to build credibility.I consulted on countless projects over the course of two years: for a baby wearables app, a mom-to-be samples gift box, a couple of college savings apps, an event planning platform, a wifi router startup, a few drone companies, a couple of 3D printing companies, etc. The list goes on.I’m not going to sugar coat this: project-based consulting is *hard.* You are always selling. There would be big scary breaks when I would have nothing on my plate because I was in the middle of discussions and awaiting replies to project proposals or testing the waters for new projects. Pay was uneven — I went into thousands of dollars of debt, borrowed money from my closest friends and family, and then got paid for months worth of delayed income, only to realize that I owed almost half of what I’d earned in taxes.Like anything else, it gets easier. You learn to hustle. You build a reputation for doing good work. Founders you’ve worked with refer you to their friends. Four years into this, my inbox was full of referrals and I had my pick of projects to fill my time.Be the business ally. So how do you move from $40/hr to $200+/hour? You have to be a trusted business ally to the most senior decision-makers in a company. If this is your goal, avoid projects that amount to ‘tasks,’ like filling out spreadsheets. If a project is something you can be trained to do it, then you’re replaceable. You want to take projects that aren’t spec’d out for you, because those are the ones where your unique set of problem-solving skills will be most valued. These are projects where you’ll have the opportunity to figure out what success looks like, how to measure it, and what milestones you’ll hit along the way. Naval Ravikant talks about this here in point 5, ‘specific knowledge,’ when he says this is knowledge that’s highly technical or creative and knowledge you can’t be trained to do. Of course, doing projects like this are much riskier, but they’re also higher impact and more valuable.Great people work on interesting things. And if something’s not working, great people will move to work other things. They know when to call it. Startups come and go, and more often than not, they fail. When you put yourself in the company of great people, you’re investing in a surer, longer term path to finding something interesting.Great people also know other great people. In this NYT article about Silicon Valley’s ‘network mafias’ the reporter aptly observed that the “start-up world projects a meritocratic image, but in reality, it is a small, tight-knit club where success typically hinges on whom you know.” It’s totally true, this place is small like you wouldn’t believe. If you work with talented people who believe in you, you’ll have kicked off the in-circle referral chain that makes it much more likely you’ll find your way to something awesome.In Part 4, I discuss the importance of building your personal brand and audience.Thanks to David King, Andrew Barkett, John Rector, Nodira Khoussainova, Anne Widera, and Doug Fulop for contributing thoughts to this.----Community builder.

Since then we’ve used the term “The world’s first mobile record label” to a great extent when marketing ourselves.We had managed to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering our users to release music on-the-go, but eventually, our users were missing the convenience of using a laptop, where they have all their working files and final assets.In a survey sent to our users where we asked what features they wanted to see in our products, 43% answered that they wanted a web service in order to be able to upload music from their laptop. This was also a common request we got in user interviews, and we’ve seen that especially more professional artists prefer to work from their computers.Amuse was founded on the ambition to relieve the artist community of classic music industry pain points. As our user community grew, we realized that although releasing music through our mobile app is very easy, the majority of people still create and finalize their music on a computer. Also, the amount of managers using Amuse to work with multiple artists has been increasing steadily since our launch. In other words, the opportunity to release music directly on desktop would simplify the process notably for a lot of users.From a UX perspective, it’s important to know your user and their needs. Mobile apps have gotten known for being easy to use, but for a music producer working all day in front of a 27” desktop computer using their phone mainly for artist communication, it might not be.It was time to build a web app.The idea of building a web app was first discussed in a funnel hack workshop. In the workshop, we looked at the steps our users had to go through to create a release and tried to come up with quick ways to remove friction so that as many artists as possible would be able to release music through Amuse. But what started out as a hack, quickly developed into one of the bigger focus points for the product org at Amuse.First, the hack became an MVP, which in the end boiled down to a service where you could release your music, but nothing else. Uploading the actual release is the most tedious part of releasing music, so it made sense to start here. Everything else was easily done through the mobile apps. We quickly discarded more advanced features and decided to release in stages. The MVP would be a so-called release builder, and we would continue to add on to our beta product throughout the year.In three months we had launched a fully functioning MVP. It quickly became our most used platform for creating releases, while our mobile apps still work as a great addition to the web service where our users can go to get detailed statistics and payout details on a daily basis.Once the MVP was launched in beta, we continued to iterate on the product and added a music tab to give our users the opportunity to see the status of a release and keep track of their catalog.When looking at how we should continue to develop the web app, it has become apparent that it’s important to frame a successful upload as the start of a release, rather than a finished process. According to Spotify themselves, nearly 40 000 tracks are uploaded to their platform every day. This makes promotion and fan engagement key factors to any artist’s success. If we can create a sense of excitement after a successful upload, it’s more likely that the artist will channel that feeling into their network and release plan.We are also continuing to build new features for our web app, but instead of aiming for feature parity, we want to build platform-specific features based on how we think the features will perform on web versus mobile. We see our web app together with our mobile apps as a part of an eco-system that should complement each other.Although still ongoing, this was a very amusing project to work on. Partly because it’s fun to create something from scratch and set a system that we will continue to build upon for a long time. But also because it was nice to get some variation from mobile, you have more space to work with so you can be somewhat more playful when it comes to text and image sizes.I hadn’t worked at Amuse for that long when we first held the funnel hack workshop where the idea of the web app sparked. From a personal perspective, I don’t remember finding it strange that Amuse was mobile-only, I actually found it quite bold when I started.For years the startup industry had been talking about mobile-first, and what Amuse did by starting out mobile-only was not only bold but also quite courageous, especially within the somewhat lagging-behind music industry.What I was contemplated by, was that a web service was not prioritized higher once it was discussed. So it’s extra fun seeing that what started out as a hack with a somewhat low priority, now is a huge part of our product roster.–My name is Evy Lybeck and I work as a product designer at Amuse. If you’d like to try our web app to release your music for free — go to artist.amuse.io to get started.Amuse is a new kind of record label giving free distribution to all artists. Major labels take huge cuts from their artists, and distribution services usually charge you per release and take a cut of your royalties. Our distribution is free, as in no fees, and no cuts. We use listening data to better determine what artists to sign to our record label. That’s how we make money.

304,38154,https://medium.com/@medtruth/friday-film-chasing-the-cure-980612f7e2cc?source=tag_archive---------40-----------------------,Friday Film: Chasing the Cure,None,"MedTruthFollow--ListenShareIt’s rare that life-altering symptoms of disease go entirely undiagnosed for years. A new show that premiered August 8th on TNT and TBS reveals the stories of those who face this reality.The bold docu-series, Chasing the Cure , is produced by journalist and former anchor, Ann Curry. In the show, doctors consider rare and extreme medical mysteries, case-by-case. Each episode invites viewers to call, text or tweet the Crowd Cure Center — the program’s 24/7 live digital platform that hosts a discussion regarding the presented cases.The first case in the premiere episode introduced Rori, a woman who had worked as a first grade teacher for more than twenty years when she was faced with neurodegenerative symptoms including muscle atrophy, early stages of belabored breathing, and an inability to walk, stand, talk, and swallow. She was forced to retire as a teacher and her family subsequently lost their home to medical debt.Rori became hopeless after more than two years of searching for a diagnosis.“We want to know, has anybody seen anything like this before?,” asked Justin, Rori’s husband.With her series, Curry aims to answer questions like these — reaching out to a wide audience in the hopes of finding someone who may recognize the undiagnosed symptoms of disease and provide adequate advice. Twitter users can share their thoughts about Rori’s case with the hashtag #HelpRori to be read on-air.Using the power of visibility amid the digital age, Curry taps into channels for connection and healing that may otherwise go unacknowledged.“Technology, medicine, journalism and television storytelling are all in a disruptive period,” Curry told . “Never before has it been possible for strangers to communicate with each other and help each other [the way they can] today.”When panelists sat down in-studio to discuss their thoughts on Rori’s case, they posited that she may be suffering from a disease related to multiple sclerosis (MS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), Lyme Disease or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Stupefied doctors responded by ordering genome sequenced testing, a swallowing study, and a world-class neuroscientist to evaluate the results. Insurance had previously denied these tests for Rori, whose case remains unresolved.Other cases shown on the pilot episode include:Hannah — a former athlete who gained over 90 pounds in one year, suffers severe head pain, and has to use the bathroom over 20 times a day. She was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).Mike — a man who, since a vacation to the Caribbean, suffers severe stomach pain and enormous bloating every time he eats solid foods. His condition, which caused drastic weight loss, is believed to be Barrett’s esophagus — a precursor to esophageal cancer.Jeremy — a man who suffers from seizures and a rare skin condition. His condition remains undiagnosed.While not all patients featured will be able to find the a diagnosis as many medical mysteries go unresolved, this show opens the door for affected survivors to be heard. Through television, Curry experimentally cultivates a community that ties together ideals of human empathy, digital outreach, patient empowerment, and medical advocacy.Tune in every Thursday at 9/8pm central to take part.Tess Francke is a freelance journalist and marketing specialist who has spent her career at the intersection of media, writing, design and health research.

You built your team. You created an MVP and you’ve even found a few potential customers.Now it’s time to grow…and fast!As operators, the team at Ripple Ventures knows that scaling can be a hard and slow process if you’re doing all the work yourself, but hiring experts requires capital. This is the point where most founders realize they need external funding, and if their friends and family have already been tapped, Venture Capital can be the next best source for strategic capital. And believe it or not, it can happen pretty fast if you’re prepared.Properly preparing for your first VC meeting will greatly affect your chances of success. There’s more to it than just expressing your vision for the company and promising a revenue chart that goes up and to the right. Investors need to not only understand your business, but also have faith in the company’s early leadership team. One of the best ways to impress institutional investors is to show that you can handle any questions and concerns they throw at you, so preparation is key.Here are 5 keys to getting VCs to say yes, and fast:This one may sound obvious, but you would be surprised by how many founders go into VC meetings not knowing the basics about a firm. Before sitting down with any investors, make sure you have looked into the following:Doing your research ahead of time ensures that you have a minimum level of understanding about the firm, the people, and the overall investment thesis. This will allow you to ask educated questions that will impress your potential investors. A good first impression can go a long way when it comes to capturing investor attention, and making them want to move forward with you quickly.Similar to doing your research, knowing your numbers (or not knowing your numbers) can greatly affect how investors view you as a founder. You need to know your numbers. Each investment firm will have different statistics they care about the most, but without exception, any educated investor will want to know the basics. While it may be tough to remember every number, here are some stats we wouldn’t enter a VC meeting without:FinancialsCustomer/User StatisticsPrevious InvestmentsMarketRemember, investors expect you to live and breath your company, and knowing your numbers lets them see you that you’re doing just that. Although your numbers may be changing constantly as you close more sales and optimize processes, having a good sense of where your company is at is an important skill for any founder.In today’s day and age, a pitch deck is an expected aid in any VC conversation. This means that VCs end up seeing hundreds to thousands of decks every year, and as such, it is very easy for an investor to get bored of a deck and move on without even fully understanding what a company does. To avoid VCs losing interest, it is important to make sure the essential points are easy to find, and that there are not too many slides and distractions. A good rule of thumb is to keep your deck to fewer than 15 slides, with any non-critical slides included in an appendix at the end. Here is a good general outline for a VC pitch deck:Having a good flow to the deck is another critical component to keep in mind, but if you cover all the topics above you should be ready for your initial VC meetings. Even though you know the contents of your slides really well, practice really does make perfect for VC pitch presentations, so make sure you put in the effort ahead of time to make sure the pitch goes flawlessly!Many great startup ideas are developed as a result of a personal problem or experience, and these stories can be a great asset for getting VCs onboard. Realizing this is the first step, but developing and refining the narrative to the point where it’s essentially a sales pitch is the hard part. Just like when building a slide deck, it’s important to be succinct when telling your story, while still being compelling. Your audience needs to believe there was actually a problem, and more importantly that the problem drove you to a novel solution that’s leagues ahead of the next-best alternative. This story can often be told as a prelude to your pitch as it is a good segway into Section 1 or 2 of the VC pitch deck template above. Once again practice makes perfect, so practice delivering your story over and over again until you can recite it in your sleep!So, you did your research, you knew your numbers, you told your story, presented your deck, and the VC is interested! They want to move forward to the next step towards committing capital, which is often getting access to your data room. A data room is a single place with all your company’s documentation, research, financials, etc. for VCs to review. It takes a lot of work for a founder to prepare a data room, and as such, this is quite often one of the slowest parts of the capital raising process. If you go into your fundraising process with a data room already put together it can streamline the review process by the investment firm and help you raise money weeks faster. Here is a good template for what investors expect to find in your data room:Folder 1: CompanyFolder 2: IndustryFolder 3: Fundraising MaterialsThis template is not exhaustive, and the more you can add to your data room the better. VCs like to know that all the cards are on the table, and by going into your conversations with a data room ready to go it creates a sense of transparency and professionalism that investors will appreciate. It is also a good idea to keep your data room up to date as your company grows, as building a new one from scratch for your next raise is a lot of work.Although the 5 keys above will go a long way in helping to secure funding for your startup, they are only part of the puzzle. Once you have completed your VC meeting it is a good idea to follow up the next day asking if any new questions have come to mind since you last spoke. Getting VCs to commit to next steps can sometimes be difficult, but always make sure to ask what their next steps would be if they are interested and identify ways to help the investors navigate the due diligence process. Raising money is a sport, and if you come prepared by using the suggestions above, you stand the best chance in receiving your financing…FAST!— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —-Thanks for reading and feel free to give us a clap!

306,27522,https://medium.com/profiles-in-entrepreneurship/a-medical-drone-startups-approach-to-navigating-regulation-building-trust-and-creating-amazing-38737c02ff9b?source=tag_archive---------43-----------------------,"A Medical Drone Startup’s Approach to Navigating Regulation, Building Trust, and Creating Amazing Teams",None,"Matthew YuanFollowProfiles In Entrepreneurship — PiE--ListenShareI first came across Zipline in a Bloomberg Technology article, “Startup Will Use Drones to Deliver Drugs and Blood Across Ghana.” Intrigued, I went to Zipline’s website. I discovered that what Zipline is doing 1) is truly incredible, and 2) comes with a daunting set of challenges. This led me to talk with Ryan Oksenhorn, Head of Software at Zipline, about how they deal with these challenges. His responses contain some surprising advice on dealing with regulation, building trust with collaborators, and building strong teams.Zipline was founded in 2014 with the mission of providing every human on Earth with instant access to vital medical supplies by drone. They are headquartered at Half Moon Bay, CA and assemble their drones in South San Francisco. Over the past 5 years, they’ve worked with the governments of Rwanda and Ghana (countries where transportation infrastructure is scarce) to develop and operate four drone delivery sites. When a doctor needs medicine, they contact a Zipline operator, who then packages the medicine and flies it out, reaching its destination within 30 minutes. Today, Zipline provides 13 million people with access to urgent medication. All of these facts informed my discussion with Ryan, which began with a topic that’s been showing up in tech news more and more frequently…1. Dealing with regulation. I could see regulation as being a major area of concern for Zipline, seeing as it operates with both medical supplies and autonomous flight. One might think about innovation and regulation as two opposing forces: Innovation is about moving fast and creating new things, while regulation is about moving slow to make sure that you don’t accidentally create something bad. If you’re working on some cutting-edge technology, regulation might feel like a burden that prevents you from achieving your goals. Ryan, however, doesn’t feel that way at all. “We [at Zipline] look at regulation as simply a constraint, a constraint that forces us to spend a lot more time finding simple, safe solutions to problems,” says Ryan. As an example, there are many stringent laws that protect the privacy of patient data, so instead of trying to build a system that tracks dozens of individual patients’ data securely, Zipline opted to not collect patient data at all. Instead, doctors notify Zipline about what medicine they want, and Zipline delivers it without ever knowing who the medicine is for. By embracing the constraint of regulation, Zipline was about to find simpler, better ways to run their operations. Just as constraints breed creativity in art, let regulation be an opportunity to rethink and discover new ways of doing things.Since autonomous flight is a relatively new technology, Zipline was able to work with regulators to shape policy, which is something that really surprised me, given the anti-regulation attitudes of companies like Google and Facebook. “Regulators haven’t figured out this puzzle [of drone regulation] yet,” says Ryan, “and they’re really excited to partner with us because they see the value of our work.” Zipline has shared the rich flight data that it’s accumulated over almost 3 years of operation with regulators. Using that data, they’ve worked together with regulators to figure out how they can better fit into existing regulatory frameworks, and even create new frameworks. Zipline’s willingness to be transparent and provide this data is really a win-win situation: they are assured that their product is lawful and safe, and regulators gain a huge amount of knowledge with which to make regulatory decisions. If you’re working on an emerging technology, consider being fully transparent with regulators from the start, and be willing to work with them, not against them. Regulators may be able to help you tweak your idea to be safer and more compliant, and they may even grant you special exceptions if they see the potential of your work. Regulators weren’t the only group that Zipline needed to work with, however. They also needed the help of…2. Government collaboration. When I imagine being a Zipline engineer, pitching a drone delivery center for the very first time to the government of Rwanda, I see myself caught in a chicken-and-egg scenario. On the one hand, I need the government’s approval and support in order to build a drone center in Rwanda. On the other hand, in order to get government support, I would need evidence that my product works in the real world, i.e., I would need to have a working drone center. In my mind, there would be no way to guarantee that the product would work. What Zipline actually did really surprised me. When they asked to partner with the Rwandan government, they didn’t have a perfect, ready-to-deploy drone delivery system to give to them. They had a few barely working drones and a genuine desire to build something together. As Ryan put it, “We weren’t a bunch of foreigners coming here saying, ‘We are the solution.’ We were saying, ‘We want to help.’” By approaching Rwanda with a rough idea and desire to help, Zipline gained Rwanda’s trust, but not because it showed that the idea would definitely work. It showed that Zipline didn’t assume they knew everything about Rwanda’s problems, but rather was eager to learn from real experience and build something together. Zipline’s approach to establishing trust with Rwanda is a form of bringing a product to market as soon as possible, even before it’s complete. If you’re working on a product to solve some problem in your community or serve some audience, don’t wait until you think you’ve solved the problem before unveiling that product. Reach out to your community as early as possible, gather input from them, learn what their needs really are. You’ll be much more likely to provide something they really want, and you’ll build trust at the same time. (Check out this article for other tips on building a strong consumer base!) Aligning your team with those you serve is super important. Also important is…3. Having a strong team. Zipline has people in two different locations in the US and four different delivery centers in Rwanda and Ghana. How do they make sure those people are all working together effectively? Ryan told me that running an effective organization involves obsessing over things that matter and NOT obsessing over things that don’t matter. For Zipline, this had led to an unconventional organizational structure that centers around their most important priority: operations. At most companies, engineers would be overseen by a project manager (PM), who would be in charge of deciding what the project’s goals and priorities are. Zipline has no PMs. Instead, engineers get feedback straight from the people using the product. “Day-to-day, our engineers report to drone operators,” Ryan told me. “Engineers regularly visit Rwanda and Ghana, and operators regularly come to Zipline HQ in California.” This constant communication and transparency means that everybody is on the same page and has what they need to get stuff done — one of Zipline’s core values is “You can’t innovate in the dark.” Zipline also does not have a single marketing person, as the value of their operations is readily seen by the people that they serve. By focusing exclusively on what’s important to their specific mission, Zipline is able to build a more effective organizational structure. When you’re managing your own venture, don’t assume that the way that other (perhaps super-successful) businesses are organized will also work for you. Design your team based on your specific situation and your specific values.Ryan couldn’t stress to me enough how important it is to hire people that share your values. When hiring, Zipline goes to great lengths to make sure that they really understand a candidate well. “You have to get to know [your job candidates] and form a deep connection with them. Invest in them enough so that you have mutual trust,” Ryan said. “When we’re really excited about someone, we do our due diligence. There are times when we will go and cook dinner with a candidate’s family or babysit one of their children, so we can really see what kind of person they are. The way we look at it, hiring someone is a leap of faith, and we want to make sure we’re right. Diligently finding one right person takes less time than hiring ten wrong people.”Talking with Ryan about Zipline was an incredibly informative experience, and it was so evident that he and the whole Zipline team are united by their desire to work on something that truly matters. I hope you can take the ideas that I’ve learned and shared with you today and use them to work on something that truly matters to you.Find out more about Zipline at their website.

That’s all very overwhelming, but Electronoobs has a new guide that will make building an Arduino smart watch seem easy.In his write-up, Electronoobs will teach you how to build a compact Arduino-compatible smart watch that packs a lot of features. Even if you’re not interested in a smart watch, these same concepts will translate well to designing all kinds of wearable devices. This device features a real-time clock, buzzer, LEDs, buttons, a Bluetooth module for communication, an I2C OLED display, a LiPo battery charging and protection circuit, and onboard CH340 chip for programming. It’s based on the same ATmega328 microcontroller found in many Arduinos and other development boards.The detailed guide will walk you through everything you need to know to go from the design stage to final assembly. You’ll learn how to design a PCB in EasyEDA, and how to get the boards manufactured affordably through JLCPCB. Once you receive your boards and all of the necessary components, Electronoobs will teach you how to use SMD hot air soldering techniques to assemble the smart watch, test each component along the way, and program it.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--1Cameron Coward--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Scott H.

That’s because RFID chips don’t require a power source of their own and can be quickly read with just a tap, which means they’re convenient to use. But “real” commercial RFID security systems can be expensive. If you’re willing to take a DIY approach, however, Giannis Vasilakis has a great tutorial on how to build one based on the Arduino Uno’s ATmega328P microcontroller.Vasilakis’ design is intended for real-world security situations. Specifically, it’s a master-slave setup that is ideal for warehouses and other locations with many security guards and multiple security check points. One of the slave RFID readers can be placed in any location where a security check point is required. To pass through, a guard would need to scan their unique RFID card. The unique ID is then sent from the slave to the remote master device over an RS-485 data bus where it can be logged. The system supports up to 254 slave devices, so this setup can be used in a large building.Both the master and slave devices run on the same ATmega328P microcontroller that is found in many Arduino boards. A custom PCB is required for each, but you could also use an actual Arduino with a breadboard if you just want to experiment with the system. Both devices use a MFRC-522 RFID module and a SN75176 RS485 transceiver. The slave devices also get a 16x2 character LCD to display the status after an RFID card swipe. 3D-printable enclosures are provided for both, as well as the code to make it all work. After setup, a computer connected to the master device can be used to pull reports of the RFID scan logs.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--1Cameron Coward--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768montysecurity--Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Gustavo Aguilar--Michael James Wilson--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Cameron Coward,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*uF7NZXF7FGgPnVr1xg5tDg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*8_YOyZPmY2Lhloa6m_aPpQ.png",2,59

There are, of course, dozens of traditional instruments you can play, and there are also a virtually unlimited number of ways to make music electronically. While there are certainly very expensive electronic instruments and MIDI controllers on the market, they don’t necessarily have to cost an arm and a leg. For instance, you can build these simple 3D-printed MIDI finger drums using an Arduino and a few inexpensive components.Most electronic drum sets utilize piezo sensors to register strikes and their force. But this project uses simple strain gauges instead. When connected to the Arduino Uno, those strain gauges can be used to measure how far a surface is bent. That’s where the 3D-printed parts come into play. The drum surface is attached to the base through a relatively thin stem. When you tap on the drum surface, the stem flexes slightly and that is registered and measured by the Arduino.Other than the Arduino and strain gauges, the only other components necessary are those to build a simple differential amplifier to boost the output of the gauges. The provided code calibrates the readings at startup so it can accurately detect taps on the drums surface. When plugged into a computer, the Arduino acts as a typical MIDI controller thanks to LoopMIDI and Hairless MIDI software. That allows you to use it with any music production software you want. Just assign some drum sounds, and start tapping!----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--1Cameron Coward--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Gianina Buda, PhDinPredict--3Ali HaiderinLevel Up Coding--1Unbecoming--768Scott H.

As for the system shown by Bitenny, it provides digital payment transaction services. digital payments are considered to have their own influence on the people who have been fixated on conventional payment systems. Digital tracing will make the process faster. Time efficiency is prioritized in this regard because the current technological age has made us to be more careful in managing time. Time is very important and to optimize it, the community must be prepared to face system changes. through this change of payment system, optimization of time can be felt directly and will provide an opportunity for users to be utilized in other matters.The question that arises now is why is Bitenny needed? We certainly have special reasons why we choose to use this platform service. some might say that Bitenny makes them faster in making payments. Payment is also easier because it uses digital media. people who are currently always seen with smart phones in their hands can optimize their use by downloading this application. to be able to take advantage of this service, users must be registered first. Furthermore, users can use Bitenny’s services to complete all payment transactions they need just by using this small device.If we dig deeper, there are still many other reasons why users should use this platform service. Bitenny is not only intended for use by individual users but also for users who come from business circles. Every community included in individual users will directly know the benefits and benefits they will get through the use of Bitenny. Bitenny can support shopping payment transactions, whether done online or offline. The thing that is of concern here is the payment for offline purchases. Digital transactions are usually only valid for purchases made online. But Bitenny has now developed a new concept where this platform can now support purchases up to offline stores. This new concept will certainly increase the public’s attention, which in the end they will decide to join this network platform. with the Bitenny application, users can easily use their digital assets to pay for the products they buy in the stores they visit.For business people or companies that run businesses, they can receive greater opportunities to get new customers who shop at them. This will certainly increase the profits of each business owner and as an effort to improve the development of the business. This convenience will be felt more by business owners who are built and run through offline shops. They can now compete with online stores because digital payment functions can now be done in their stores. With the support of a number of currencies, offline stores will further optimize the function of this digital payment system. this can be proven through differences in the profits obtained from stores that only apply one single currency to stores that implement multi currencies. Stores that implement multi currencies will benefit more because their facilities can cover areas that cannot be reached by stores that only apply a single currency.For investors, by investing some funds into the Bitenny platform, they will benefit from every BTNY digital token sale. The wider distribution of BTNY digital tokens will further increase the value of this token in the cryptocurrency market. this will provide greater benefits with them investing. This profit will be a way for this platform to gain greater trust from the community as an investment platform. Multiple profits will be obtained with more and more users joining Bitenny.The Bitenny platform has shown a very significant role in managing the changing times that will continue. Changes in the payment system are a small example that will determine even greater changes in the future.Website: http://bitenny.io/White Paper: http://bitenny.io/assets/img/BitennyWhitepaper.pdfFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Bitennyio-935538879978419/?modal=admin_todo_tourTwitter: https://twitter.com/Bitenny_ioTelegram: https://t.me/BitennyNewsLinkedIN: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitennyofficial----Suas part--Suas part--Suas part--Suas part--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Suas part,https://medium.com/@suaspart,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*aQrZyLr8UCYUJYaYmVE6Fg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3tlFRQydF4bzruGkQoh0hA.png",4,1

Un video de 2 minutos para difundir MITI.El primer impulso para diseñar la pauta, fue tratar de explicar lo que somos como asociación, a través de nuestro propósito y lo que hacemos.Para mostrar lo que hacemos, agrupamos nuestras acciones del 2018 y lo planificado para este año 2019 en 3 conceptos, que reflejan nuestro espíritu: Confianza, Colaboración y Pasión inspiradora.1. Confianza:La confianza que hay entre los asociados nos define como organización. Todas las empresas que entran a MITI están dispuestas a compartir sus números y compartir prácticas de gestión, para ayudar a que las demás empresas de la asociación mejoren día a día. Esto además de hacerse realidad a través de los canales de comunicación abiertos y los encuentros entre los asociados, se refleja en nuestras métricas compartidas anuales, que nos permiten analizar las distintas estrategias y su impacto en los resultados.Así mismo, este año 2019, implementamos mesas de trabajo, para ahondar y mejorar nuestras prácticas en metodologías, estrategia de ventas e internacionalización, para posteriormente difundirlas y poder mejorar de este modo a la industria.2. Colaboración:Entendemos que la única manera de impactar, es unirse y ejercer fuerza conjunta. Es por esto, que trabajamos unidos con la academia y otras organizaciones.El año 2018, la Universidad de Los Andes realizó nuestro estudio de satisfacción laboral, una iniciativa que comenzamos el año 2017 para todas las empresas MITI. Esto, con la finalidad de darle mayor profesionalismo, transparencia y poder expandir este estudio más allá de nuestra asociación para ofrecer así una buena herramienta a otras empresas de nuestra industria.También destacamos nuestra colaboración con la Universidad de Chile, para desarrollar en conjunto una metodología para estimar los esfuerzos en el desarrollo de software.Y por supuesto nuestro apoyo y participación en eventos como la StarsConf y 9punto5, a los cuales este año 2019 se suma Code Ñuble.3. Pasión inspiradora:La tecnología tiene el potencial de ser un motor de desarrollo para el país y sabemos que en Chile está el talento. Queremos que nuestra pasión por las TI inspire. Pero no solo a los que hoy son parte, sino que también a los más jóvenes. Para ello, el 2018 hicimos un ciclo de talleres de innnovación y emprendimiento en la USACH y charlas motivacionales en la Univarsidad Católica. Así mismo, junto a Technovation, realizamos actividades para nuestros talentos más jóvenes aún en etapa escolar.Este año, también sumamos meetups y por supuesto más posts en nuestro blog.Sin embargo, para lograr que el video fuese atractivo e interesante de ver hasta al final, había que huir del típico video latero. Así que todo lo anterior fue eliminado y comenzamos nuestra pauta de 0, tratando de responder una sola pregunta:¿Cuál es la esencia de nuestra asociación?Y este es el video.----MejorIndustriaTIGerente en MITI: Asociación por una Mejor Industria TI.

He well justified his sun sign. He was a prodigy too and very early showed signs of great powers of learning.If you would see his speeches on youtube, you can see a leader in him.I feel sorry for myself that I didn’t saw this documentary earlier.The documentary about the life of Aaron is very inspiring to me on so many levels. The boy had the guts to do whatever he wanted to do. The man stood for something he truly believed in. He knew there was a problem and he didn’t wait for anyone to solve it. He stood up and decided to solve it.No one does that. No one raises true agendas anymore. We are all scared like shit and our cowardliness is covered by our fake bravery on Social Media.In the afternoon my mother was asking why Salman never works with Arijit and I told him that Arijit and Mithoon insulted him on stage once. They both couldn’t understand the gravity of it.There are things that you do in life that can destroy your entire career because at that moment you never realize what you are doing.But here is a thing, at that moment in front of Salman both Arijit and Mithoon both stood for themselves. I know they were wrong and in this case, I would side Salman as he didn’t do anything wrong to provoke them so much. Still, if they took the ground, they should have stick to it.But Arijit apologized later. He begged Salman to give him work in his movie. He even wrote an entire written apology on Facebook.That is why he can never be a good leader and that is why I had lost respect for him. For the rest of his life, he is going to regret what he wrote as a form of apology on Facebook.But Aaron never did that. He never apologized. I guess when you know you are right, there is no fear.He didn’t accept the plea bargain that asked him to plead guilty just so that he could save himself from going to prison for 35 years and get fined for 1 million US dollars.And what was his crime?He merely stole some articles and data from a website called Jstore, who by the way retracted all charges against him later. But the government decided to prosecute him and run the case anyways.He was a threat. He was a threat to the government. He was someone who was a major force behind the failure of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) bill that Congress was forcibly implementing earlier but later after Aaron’s protests, some of the top websites protested too and went non-functional and went black for a day.It was then that Congress realized that the matter was way bigger than they took it for. Most of the votes which were in favour of SOPA act later turned against it in the Congress.They won. The internet won. Aaron won.However, it was a short-lived victory for him and soon they charged him with 13 rounds of felony cases for a minor data theft that didn’t make any sense to anyone. They simply wanted to make an example of him for other hackers and send a signal that if they attempt any such thing, even bleakly small, they will not be spared.Politicians and Police system does not understand how intelligence breeds. Just look at the examples of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. How they have changed the world by initially fooling people to buy illegal products that they made.With Aaron, we not only lost an activist of free internet, but we also lost a great mind which could have changed the world with his thinking and ideology. I still can’t believe that he is dead.They say it was difficult earlier than today to change the world and make people accept a new idea and I say that it is far more difficult today than ever to convince the world of anything.Earlier people didn’t have any knowledge and that’s why they would reject everything but today people reject because they know too much (mostly with redundant information) and since their minds are already occupied with thoughts of their own, they have no space for better ideas.----A Film Director|| An Author At Amazon || Quora Writer || Medium Writer || Book Reader || Film Enthusiast and Critic || Motivational Speaker.

315,32595,https://medium.com/@sjmccroskey/one-year-at-terane-f83e347d0775?source=tag_archive---------73-----------------------,One Year at Terane.,None,"Sean McCroskeyFollow--2ListenShareOn this day exactly one year ago, I started at what Terane was formerly known as, Dirtbook.I was first introduced to Colt through an intro from Michael Eady of Knight Eady Sports and a couple of weeks later we met for the first time for lunch at Taco Mama in Homewood. From the beginning of our conversation, I felt very comfortable with Colt, he was a guy that wanted to build something that would help change the way his family construction company built homes. He conveyed a sense that he was willing to take a chance on me and give me the opportunity to learn together with him as we built the company from the ground-up.It may have not been the sexiest tech-start-up opportunity in town, but it was for sure an incredible opportunity to learn and grow. I signed on a little over 2-weeks later as Dirtbook’s only full-time employee. I couldn’t be happier that I'm still here, learning and growing every single day.As I think about my past-year here are some reflections on a few of the things that I have learned in 1 year in,Optimism Breeds SolutionsI heard this quote from Ryan Graves, the first full-time employee at Uber. I think it applies to all start-ups and the culture they want to create. I don’t think we’re ever short on optimism at Terane, even on the rough days, and because of that, we’ve been able to drive the company forward each week.It’s about the Right PeopleYou hear it all the time and this absolutely applies to hiring the right people, but more often than not as a start-up employee, it also applies to who you get advice from, the companies you partner with, and the conventions you attend.Time is one of the most valuable resources for a start-up and you have to make sure you spend that time with the right people that will help you move the needle. You can get advice from as many founders/advisors/ investors as you want, but only a few will actually give you advice that will benefit your business. That's the power of law of people.Surprise YourselfWhen I started at Terane, there was so much I didn’t know or didn’t know how to do. It was walking a fine line of ineptitude which is having knowledge of how to do something, but not being able to execute properly and ignorance which is executing without any knowledge what so ever.There was a lot I had to teach myself: how to build a website, set-up gsuite and link our domain, e-mail marketing on Mailchimp, work-flow automation through Zapier, creating/editing a pitch deck, putting together convertible note documents for our investors, etc. I was surprised by how well things turned out each time I had to learn something new(granted these efforts took me many tries). When I got our emails set up with our domains on G-Suite It felt like I had hit a game-winner during March Madness.Surprising yourself, makes those little victories seem a little bigger, and as a start-up, you need to take pride in those little victories and keep building on them.It’s awesome to look back on this past year on what has been built, 8 team members, a new office in the depot, and a launched product with over 60 paying customers. We’re growing and learning every day, and I'm so proud to be a part of what we’re building and going to continue to build here at Terane.Thanks to Colt, David, Byron, Nathan, Viraj, Ashley, and Bobby for being such an awesome little team and for my family, Caroline, and friends for the support.I'm excited for what's in store for the future and the continued success of the Terane community.----2Associate @ Atento CapitalSean McCroskeyinAtento Capital--Sean McCroskeyinAtento Capital--Sean McCroskey--Sean McCroskeyinAtento Capital--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Sean McCroskey,https://medium.com/@sjmccroskey,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HlS9TO1CPD5I5-81SuvSYw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FgletloHE70f4vS0GPFP9g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Kke05kXEoAocoi3arPDNQQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VD3tGHAjzHvA-6iTvGXTJA.jpeg",4,9

In fact, every city in the World is going to double in size, bringing us from roughly 40% to 70% coverage of urban areas. Of course, such an increase in population density is going to have to be proportional to the increase in efficiency, meaning that we need to build new infrastructure in order to support governance and the economy itself.Three main pillars must be put in place as a first step to laying the foundation for the progress of the 21st century, which will inevitably lead to a new lifestyle paradigm based on the concept of decentralization: identity, ownership and tradability. In particular:We need to have self-sovereign identity, meaning that each one of us should have the power tools to creates his/her own identity and is in charge of it, while reputation is given by the validation that is received from the others in the widespread community. It is going to be more and more important to have one single, real, digital identity that cannot be changed, like any digital identity as we know it today, and that is not assigned by the government.If everything is going to be tokenized, then citizens must be able to own anything through such tokens. For example, having the token to a proprietary house is proof of the ownership of the house itself and knowing the private key to that token will be the future equivalent of storing the door keys to it. Not to mention, ownership means that understanding how we can transfer such rights on goods and services is going to be required, which brings us to the third and last pillar of a smart society.In today’s World of “paper things” ownership is usually bound up with identity, making it non-tradable, but in the tokenized version of the World it will be possible to separate the two aspects of identity and ownership, thus offering the possibility to free up liquidity in the market, when KYC is not a main prerequisite, making it much more efficient and price-driven.One common misconception, which especially the last pillar might inspire, is that all smart cities of the future are going to have their own local coins, but, not only is that not going to happen, above all it should not happen; an economy has to have a certain scale, not too large like the Eurozone, and must represent a single culture, in order to ensure reciprocity and market connectivity among all geographical components comprised in such economic area. Nonetheless, there may be some specialized coins in the World, like a philanthropic or eco-sustainable coin, but most currencies are going to be regional and we must learn how to manage these money supplies, which is something that we have not proved to be good at in past issuances of cryptocurrencies. The main concern is the oscillation from inflation to deflation, which might wipe the coin out if it doesn’t have something that stabilizes it, and that is exactly why non-collateralized stablecoins are seen as the best solution. In fact, Bitcoin is never going to be used for payments and nor is Ether, since having a fixed supply will inevitably cause the value of the currency to be extremely dependent on demand forces and thus be volatile; whereas non-collateralized stablecoins can be programmed to have elastic supplies managed algorithmically by a software instead of central banks, dilating the time span from one cyclical recession to the other or maybe drastically changing the cyclical pattern itself.Another crucial topic related to smart cities is that of personal data in relation to decentralization. Decentralization is mainly based on the idea that each person should own the respective personal data — yes, you should own your personal data instead of Microsoft and drug companies. Blockchain will be the means through which the citizens can collect and hold personal data, whether it be medical data, educational history or financial data. Blockchain will make it easy to just walk into a new doctor’s office because all that is going to be needed is the patient’s phone, which, if allowed by the owner through a private key, will automatically transfer to this new doctor the records of where the patient has been cured before, how and for what kinds of condition. Of course, there are a lot of legal frameworks working against this scenario of self-sovereignty and a lot of risks as well that still need to be addressed, like that of data forks, but technology does not seem to be hindered. The main goal is that to achieve a situation in which the offer of services to the citizens is going to be personalized and the delivery of such services as efficient as ever, thanks to the direct access that each citizen may want to grant to their personal “data lockers”.What about voting, you may ask? In the era of smart cities, government should start recognizing the ownership of tokens as giving us citizens’ rights, among which voting is one of the most important. Blockchain is going to impact and change the governance. For example, once elections are over, the funds and the budgets may be locked up in a smart contract and only released when there is proof that the representatives are actually doing what they have promised. Such system will let people express their wishes and then just let the software execute those wishes by moving money or by moving the levers of power to allow things to happen; we could have less representation and more active participation by the citizens. This was actually included in a cutting-edge research on how society could run itself using market forces, auctions and incentive games, rather than the judgment of experts and elected City Council members.Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things are going to be integrated to the Blockchain infrastructure of the ideal smart city of the future. Everyone is already talking about driverless cars and drones, but one must appreciate the fact that having information about any “thing” that we use and having mesh networks of such information continuously flowing will really benefit society — and not just because we will automatically be notified when our refrigerator is out of cheese!The buying and selling of real estate could become as easy as swapping tokens on the marketplace through a phone application. The same may happen with commodities, like diamonds. Diamonds are interesting because they are unique and non-fungible, meaning that two diamonds may even have the same weight and the same cut but are still not interchangeable because they have diverse quarks. We all know that the market of diamonds can be quite deceiving, but, if every diamond is tokenized, then every diamond everywhere could be visible on the Internet and a potential buyer could use semantic search to locate the ones that are closer to what they are exactly looking for and compare prices in real time, eliminating arbitrage. Semantic search happens whenever we can tag a product or service with its proper identifiers, leveling out the metadata that describes it, and locate on a map everything that corresponds to our specific desires. Of course, this new way of managing the markets, made possible by the integration of the most disruptive technologies, restricts manipulation of prices and, through a token economy, incentivizes positive behaviors. Long story short, markets may start looking like a real-life playing field dominated by game theory rules.Being that these are the prerequisites, it must finally be emphasized that smart cities, like any other type of city, will have to guarantee to the citizen and to all the stakeholders involved in their ecosystem the cross operation of a wide variety of services, which in turn must be performed in a “smart” way. In the upcoming articles, every aspect of this innovative urban structure will be analyzed in detail.----Tokenomics Expert | Token Model Engineer | Blockchain Advisor | SpeakerEloisa Marchesoni--1Eloisa MarchesoniinBLOCK6--4Eloisa MarchesoniinBLOCK6--Eloisa MarchesoniinBLOCK6--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Avi Bar-ZeevinPredict--2Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alexander--2HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Eloisa Marchesoni,https://medium.com/@eloisa.marchesoni,1,6,0
317,3863,https://medium.com/@patrickstepanek/alexa-conference-in-chattanooga-tn-a5aec55fa902?source=tag_archive---------158-----------------------,"Alexa Conference in Chattanooga, TN",None,"Patrick StepanekFollow--ListenShareAfter spending three straight days thinking and collaborating about the future of the voice space, a few underlying messages became clear. The direction of the voice industry has yet to be determined and every player has an opportunity to forge the path future creators take.If you would like to hear our podcast that we did live at the event:Day 1: https://anchor.fm/voice-first/episodes/Alexa-Conference-Day-1-e2uqosDay 2: https://anchor.fm/voice-first/episodes/Alexa-Conference-Day-2-e2v55cThe convention we attended was held in Chattanooga, TN because of their fast internet service and proximity to the south and the east coast. Throughout the course of the conference, we had the pleasure of meeting the Mayor of Chattanooga and exploring the town. The event was held at the Chattanooga Convention center located right downtown. There was a large assembly hall where the main speakers explained their theories and also four smaller rooms for break out sessions. During the break out sessions, people at the conference had more hands-on experience, asking speakers about specific ideas they had in the voice industry. The main topics of discussion were split between healthcare, storytelling and consumer marketing.Each topic drew different businesses that were interested to learn how they can utilize voice technology to ultimately make more money. There was a huge difference in the topic of discussion between healthcare and other topics. This is because there are many considerations you have to make with health data that simply do not apply to simpler apps. When structuring data collection in voice apps relating to health care, it is important that we can protect the medical information of anyone involved with the technology. Often, businesses are asking to remove their data from the larger services like Google or Amazon and storing the information on their own internal databases to maintain data access. In each session we attended, there was a different purpose guiding the discussion.After attending a handful of sessions about podcasting it became more clear to me just how early we are in the voice space. At the beginning of one presentation about podcasts, the presenter asked everyone that was working on a podcast to raise their hands. Nearly everyone in the room put their hand up. Whether or not they have a successful podcast with interesting guests, they are working on it. What stood out to me about the creators in the space is the massive disparity between podcasts and flash briefings. For those of you that are unfamiliar, a flash briefing is a quick couple minute update about something going on in a particular area. They are becoming increasingly popular as people are adopting voice devices. Yet there are 80x more podcasts than there are flash briefings. It is currently an area that needs more development and time. If you are looking for a new way to engage with your audience of people, perhaps you should consider a weekly flash briefing.In the consumer marketing sessions, there was one clear message throughout each. People prefer to interact with real voices rather than the default Alexa voice everyone is accustomed to. When we hear the voice of a real person, we are much more likely to remember and enjoy the experience beyond the context of using a voice app. We met the founder of a company called voices.com that provides other businesses with voiceovers from voice actors from around the country. His service offers businesses the chance to find unique voices for any promotions or media. Many businesses that are working on creating their own voice apps were thinking about how they wanted to create their sonic brand. When you hear the 21st-century fox intro, you immediately think of their brand. The same could be said for the McDonald’s jingle. Not every business is capable of creating a sound that their customers will remember, but by using a particular sound whenever your voice app opens you give your business a better chance of doing so.Storytelling was an interesting topic of discussion. One speaker suggested that humans have been storytelling as long as we have been alive. Perhaps the ways in which we are telling stories is changing over time, but the core constructs have been ageless. With voice, we are going to enable people to tell stories with much more context. One tool we met the creator for was Chompers. Created by Gimlet Media, Chompers is a tool that helps parents train their kids to brush their teeth. They created 600 2 minute videos for kids to watch while they brush their teeth. After collecting data from users, they found kids that used Chompers were much more likely to pick up the habit of brushing their teeth twice every day. It is little tools like this that I believe will slowly bring more value to using voice devices.On the second day of the conference, our team was granted the opportunity to present to the rest of the conference. We spoke about our dry cleaning app that is working towards automating the process of doing laundry. Being able to speak about Voice First and all of the projects we are currently working was really beneficial to be able to get feedback from other people at the conference about the direction we should create. There are so many verticals to fill in the voice space that it can often be overwhelming deciding which to pursue.Throughout the course of pitching our business, we realized that the apps we want to focus on first are the ones that directly save people time. This way, if someone uses our apps they will be saving time that they can spend doing what they love or finding new avenues to spend their time. By focusing on creating solutions for the actions that are taking up a lot of people’s time, we will be etching out more time to use other tools in the future that bring value in area’s people otherwise would not have had enough time for.Each business that was in attendance of the World Alexa Conference was taking on the voice industry from a unique perspective. We spoke with people creating hardware that will make it easier to hear for those with hearing impairment. Those who are hard of hearing with this tool will be able to interact with voice technology to adapt to the world. We spoke to the team at Epson printers who is working on figuring out how to activate your printer with voice. Need your tax documents from April 2016? No problem. Any file that you have deep within your computer can be immediately brought to life with a quick command. We also spoke to companies who are making it easier for business people to create voice apps that are specific to the industry they are in and the customers they serve. We tried to learn from everyone and replicate the processes that other people are using that could benefit voice first within our own company.The World Alexa conference was 5x larger than last year, and from everything we heard, it is only going to get larger through the years. Every business that we were in conversation with has changed drastically over the course of the last year, and we anticipate that this will continue to happen for a long time. The reason I find the voice space to be so interesting is that the people who are involved in it in 2018 & 2019 are literally shaping the future actions of creators in 2028 & 2029. The industry best practices are being established by the people who are willing to stop talking and start executing & creating.----Natural United FounderPatrick Stepanek--Patrick Stepanek--2Patrick Stepanek--Patrick Stepanek--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Josep FerrerinGeek Culture--72HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Patrick Stepanek,https://medium.com/@patrickstepanek,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zjAt33dN9ose2DO87oS9vA.jpeg",6,0

For example, it is easy to envision how properties of all kinds could be liquified, tokenized and traded much like stocks on exchanges. This blockchain example will also positively affect transaction times as property sellers find they can sell fractions of shares on a particular property, as opposed to having to search for a single buyer. As well as this, it is more than likely that the whole real estate industry will benefit from this shift, by lowering the barrier of entry to real estate investment. New definitions of property ownership and rental contracts will arise from this shift in the real estate business.The user-friendly automation of all relevant processes and documentation on a decentralized, blockchain real estate platform could also help by cutting out additional inspection costs, registration and loan fees, as well as property taxes, all enforced by quantifiable smart contracts.It is also important to note how blockchain uses could potentially revolutionize rental property payments. Cost-efficiency and better decision-making in leasing transactions can be achieved with a shared database, where a whole vertical of stakeholders including owners, tenants and service providers can interact with ownership information, or transaction history in an open, secure way.Combined with new models of flat ownership that could potentially span the global market, decentralized payment projects could be used to facilitate low-cost, high-speed transnational micropayments which would distribute the payment among all stakeholders concerned. Within the context of payments, introduction of smart contracts into blockchain real estate ledgers and transactions has clear potential in streamlining various real estates processes, such as releasing apartment ownership, or rental documents upon completion of a cryptocurrency transfer. Overall, the benefits of this aspect of blockchain use cases, when applied to real estate, are already being recognized by a variety of private institutions and governmental bodies.----www.leax.ioLeax Foundation - Leaxcoin (LEAX)--Leax Foundation - Leaxcoin (LEAX)--Leax Foundation - Leaxcoin (LEAX)--Leax Foundation - Leaxcoin (LEAX)--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Max YampolskyinDataDrivenInvestor--16Jon CrabbinCoinmonks--21Henrique CentieiroinDataDrivenInvestor--2Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Christoph RichterinMC² Ventures--1HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Leax Foundation - Leaxcoin (LEAX),https://medium.com/@LeaxFoundation,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3iiZH0olbxwNh4clMiAU8g.jpeg",2,2

323,2542,https://medium.com/@systango/develop-publish-your-own-android-library-9e41041718fb?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,Develop & Publish Your Own Android Library,None,"SYSTANGOFollow--ListenShare“Android was intended to be very customizable. And we welcome innovations.” — Sundar PichaiA few days ago, we launched an Android library called Face SDK, which allows developers to detect a person’s face with liveness detections, i.e. smile, blink, etc. with few lines of code.In addition to JAR files, the Android also makes use of a binary distribution format called Android ARchive (AAR). The .aar bundle is nothing but the binary distribution of an Android Library Project.An AAR is similar to a JAR file, but it can contain both resources and compiled byte-code. An AAR file can be included in the build process of an Android app similar to a JAR file.As we all are familiar, in Android Studio, if you wish to include any library, for example, SmilePass Face SDK, you can do it by adding following lines to build.gradle file-dependencies {implementation 'com.smilepass.mobilesdk:facesdk:1.0.0'}Have you ever wondered how does gradle pull library from the repository? Basically, we need to know that a gradle dependency string consists of three parts-dependencies {implementation 'GROUP_ID:ARTIFACT_ID:VERSION'}In the above example, GROUP_ID is com.smilepass.mobilesdk, ARTIFACT_ID is facesdk and VERSION is 1.0.0.GROUP_ID- It defines the name of the library group. It is possible that multiple libraries which perform the job of the same context can belong to the same GROUP_ID. For example, the Android support library has the same GROUP_ID com.android.support for multiple support libraries. Here is the example-dependencies {implementation 'com.android.support:design:' + supportLibVersionimplementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:' + supportLibVersionimplementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:' + supportLibVersionimplementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:' + supportLibVersionimplementation 'com.android.support:exifinterface:' + supportLibVersion}When you add a gradle dependency to the build.gradle file and sync the project, Gradle will ask maven repository if corresponding AAR and other files exist. For example, for the gradle dependency com.smilepass.mobilesdk:facesdk:1.0.0, you could find its library files from-http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/smilepass/mobilesdk/facesdk/0.0.5-alphaThen Android Studio downloads those files to our machine and compiles the project. Now you can access functionalities of this SDK in your project.AAR file is developed on top of a JAR file. It was invented because JAR file cannot contain Android specific files i.e. resources, manifest, assets, JNI etc. An AAR file contains all these things and it is a normal compressed file like JAR. It contains JAR file inside it with the classes.jar name. The structure of the AAR file is as follows-- /AndroidManifest.xml (mandatory)- /classes.jar (mandatory)- /res/ (mandatory)- /R.txt (mandatory)- /assets/ (optional)- /libs/*.jar (optional)- /jni/<abi>/*.so (optional)- /proguard.txt (optional)- /lint.jar (optional)When you get a chance to develop your own SDK for the first time, few questions are likely to come in your mind-So that’s all? Are these questions enough to get started?The answer is — NO.You might not realize, but each question is the root of other sub-questions. When you dive in the ocean of these questions, you will feel many things coming towards you. To float your boat well, we have summarized these questions in this tutorial.Development & ArchitectureCreate a new Android library project with the following steps in Android Studio-You will see the following dialog-Select Android Library and click Next.Enter library name, module name, and package name. Select minimum SDK version supported and click on Finish. You will see newly created module added in the project.implementation project(':facesdk')Replace “facesdk” with your module name.There are a number of architectures for building an Android application i.e. MVP, MVVM etc. But when you don’t have any view, choosing these architectures would not be a good idea.Some libraries contain UI elements i.e. Google Maps; sometimes your library is the abstraction of REST APIs i.e. Microsoft Cognitive SDK; sometimes you are providing widgets to prettify user’s applications i.e. Android Support Libraries.One more challenge while development is taking API Key from the user and notify the user if it is a correct. Google takes API key in Manifest, whereas Microsoft Cognitive SDK takes it in the constructor of its REST client.To be precise, the decision of good architecture, API key management, exception handling will depend on your requirements.An example of the package structure for REST API calling SDK is as follows-SmilePassRestClient is the main class which contains feature methods i.e. register(). Create listeners and exceptions to provided parsed result to user.ObfuscationProguard is used to shrink, obfuscate, optimize code. Proguard is necessary for your library to remove unused code and make reverse engineering little difficult.Proguard rules for the library are different from the normal applications. As you know, Proguard renames classes, variables, and methods using meaningless names. You would like to keep the names of those methods and classes as it is that developers will call. You will need to test and verify obfuscated code from generated AAR file.In your project explorer, you will see two proguard files, one for the “app” module and another for the new library module you created now (in our case, it’s “facesdk”)-Copy and paste the content of this Proguard File which has library specific proguard rules.Finally set minifyEnabled true in library’s gradle file under buildTypes.There are plenty of platforms for hosting your Android library and create its gradle or maven dependency. You can choose over JitPack or JCenter or Maven Central.We prefer JCenter and we are going to teach how to publish your library in JCenter.You must have seen these lines in root level build.gradle file in an Android Project-repositories { jcenter()}The advantage of choosing jCenter over others is, any new project in Android Studio by default includes jCenter, so the developers using your library won’t have to add any additional configuration except gradle dependency with implementation line in app level build.gradle file.Second thing is, jCenter is the largest Java repository on the planet. It is the superset of maven central. It means, whatever available in maven central is already available in jCenter.The third advantage is, it is pretty easy to upload your own library to Bintray. There is no requirement to sign them or do demanding things like you have to on Maven Central.Since jCenter is hosted on JFrog Bintray, create a new account on it by clicking on sign up.You can sign up using GitHub, Twitter, Google or by directly entering your email ID and other details. Create an organization for which you are going to create the library. Once you finish sign up and create an organization, log in to your account and select organization, you will see following dashboard-You will see organization name at the top, repositories (we will create it in the next step) and other details you have filled.The next step is creating a repository. Click on “Add New Repository” button on the profile dashboard, you will see the following form-You can provide any name for your repository but we recommend “maven”, as it describes that it is a maven repository for all your Android and Java libraries. Select “Maven” in type. Provide license, description, and select avatar.Once created, you will be redirected to the profile dashboard. You can see your new repository name in theOwned Repositories list section. Click on the repository title there and you will be directed to the following repository page-The next step is creating a package. Package in the Bintray is created for every module project. If you have multiple modules in your project, you need to create separate packages for them. Click on the “Add New Package” button on the repository page and you will get the following form-The package name is generally your project’s package i.e. com.smilepass.mobilesdk.If you have multiple projects under the same group id, you can add your artifact id in package name for the ease of understanding i.e. com.smilepass.mobilesdk:facesdk.If you have private GIT repo for the library project, you can provide the link of the public sample app GitHub repository. Fill all the details and go to the package page. You will see package page as follows-Every time you create a new version of your library, you will need to create the version of the version from Bintray dashboard also. Click on “New Version” and you will see a small form as follows-Fill the version name i.e. 1.0.0 and its description and click on “Create Version”. After creating a version, you will be redirected to the package details page. Now go to the version page. You will see the following page with empty details on “Maven build settings”, as your library is not published yet.API Key is used for the authentication to upload your AAR file to the Bintray. Go to the Bintray dashboard and click on your name at top-right corner. You will see the following drop-down with profile related options-Click on the “Manage Organizations” which will redirect you to the following edit profile page-Click on the last option “API Key” from the left panel. Copy the API Key and keep it with you. You will need it while uploading the library.We are done with the setup of Bintray. Now it’s time to configure Bintray on library code in Android Studio.After the setup of Bintray package and version, you need to configure your library in Android Studio.First, add following plugins in root level build.gradle file in dependencies section-classpath 'com.jfrog.bintray.gradle:gradle-bintray-plugin:1.8.0'classpath 'com.github.dcendents:android-maven-gradle-plugin:2.1'Next step is to configure library details i.e. group id, artifact id, license etc. You also need to add Bintray credentials, package and version details. Add the following details to your library’s build.gradle file-apply plugin: 'com.android.library'apply plugin: 'com.github.dcendents.android-maven'apply plugin: 'com.jfrog.bintray'ext {bintrayRepo = 'maven' // Name of the Bintray repo you createdbintrayName = 'com.smilepass.mobilesdk' // Bintray package namepublishedGroupId = 'com.smilepass.mobilesdk' // Group ID of the SDK which will be added in implementation line of gradleartifact = 'smilepass' // Artifact ID of the SDK which will be added in implementation line of gradlelibraryVersion = '1.0.0' // Version of the library you created in BintraylibraryName = 'SmilePass' // It is generally the module namelibraryDescription = 'SmilePass biometric face verification SDK' // Small description of the librarysiteUrl = 'https://github.com/SmilePass-ltd/SmilePass-SDK-Android'gitUrl = 'https://github.com/SmilePass-ltd/SmilePass-SDK-Android.git'developerId = 'smilepassltd'developerName = 'SmilePass Ltd.'developerEmail = 'info@smile-pass.com'licenseName = 'The Apache Software License, Version 2.0'licenseUrl = 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt'allLicenses = [""Apache-2.0""]//Bintray CredentialsbintrayUsername = System.getenv(""bintrayUsername"") // Your Bintray usernamebintrayApiKey = System.getenv(""bintrayApiKey"") // API Key you copied in previous stepbintrayUserOrg = System.getenv(""bintrayUserOrg"") // Organization you created in Bintray}android {...}dependencies {implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])...}apply from: 'bintray.script'You can see the comments in ext{…} section for the explanation of those variables clearly.Look at the credentials part, I prefer saving credentials in the environment variable as saving credentials in the code is not secure. Alternatively, you can add credentials in local.properties file also.Now you can see the last line of the gradle file above. Here you need to apply path of Bintray script which will upload library files to the Bintray. You can download this script from here and copy on the module’s directory.After all configuration and credentials setup, it’s time to generate the AAR and other files. Open a terminal, go to your project’s root directory and run following command-gradlew installIf you see any javadoc related error, there is a small workaround for it (If you find any other solution for it, please share in comment). Add following line in root level build.gradle-subprojects {tasks.withType(Javadoc).all { enabled = false }}After that, run the install command again. The build generation process will be started and you will see following message on the success-BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 46s27 actionable tasks: 17 executed, 10 up-to-dateAfter a successful build, it’s time to upload your library to Bintray. We can do it by running following command in the same terminal-gradlew bintrayUploadAfter successful upload, you will see a similar BUILD SUCCESSFUL like message as mentioned above.Now go to the version page on Bintray and you will see your library details i.e. maven and gradle dependency settings there.If you add a gradle dependency that you just created in any other project, you will get an error like “failed to resolve com.yourlibraryname…”. It’s because your package is added to Bintray repo only, not in jCenter yet.To add the package in jCenter, click on the “Add to jCenter” button as shown in the bottom-right in below image-You will be redirected to a form which will require small detail about your package. Write a brief about your library and submit the request. After submission, jCenter team reviews and approves the package which takes around 2–3 hours to 2–3 days. When they approve, you will get a notification on Bintray. Add to jCenterbutton will not be there and you will see following jCenter badge-If your package is not added to the jCenter and still you want to integrate your library, you can do it by explicitly specifying your repository URL. For that, click on the blue “SET ME UP!” button and then click on “Resolving artifacts using Gradle” as shown below-Copy this maven URL and add in repositories section.Congratulations! Your library is ready to use.You are ready with gradle dependency and you have tested it. It’s time to show your work to the world. How will you inform developers all around the world about your beautiful Android library?The most simple and convenient way is, create a public GitHub repository and add a sample application which demonstrates the use and features of your library.It’s not just about informing, developers will expect a well-structured introduction, integration guide, tutorials, and troubleshooting tips.What are the best practices to provide integration guide and SDK tutorials? Is it good to provide sample application or sample code? What problems may occur on integrating your SDK in any app and how to provide troubleshooting and resolution steps?We have added the introduction of library and basic integration guide in the README.md file. Apart from this, it’s good practice to add tutorial and troubleshooting documents in wiki pages. We have added some wiki pages as shown in below image-You can check full documentation on SmilePass FaceSDK Sample.After performing all these steps, you will be able to successfully distribute your Android library to the developers. Although it looks a very lengthy and complicated process, the steps are quite straightforward. For example, most of the steps of setup and configurations related to publishing the SDK are one time. It will require little effort from the next time.Developing the library is a great idea for both, your in-house projects or public libraries. You can use the add the module in any project without rewriting or copy-paste the same code again and again in different projects. Gradle makes it easy to integrate the library in just a few lines. You can scale the code easily and upgrade as per your need.Hope you get complete clarity there and wish to see your awesome library!

This is nothing but how to program computers to process and analyse large amounts of natural language data.In another way, Natural language processing is the capability of computer software to understand human language as it is spoken. NLP is one of the component of artificial intelligence (AI).About NLTKNamed Entity Recognition (NER)Named Entity Recognition is used in many fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and it can help to answer many real-world questions.Named entity recognition(NER) is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.Information comes in many shapes and sizes.One important form is structured data, where there is a regular and predictable organization of entities and relationships.For example, we might be interested in the relationship between companies and locations.Given a company, we would like to be able to identify the locations where it does business; conversely, given a location, we would like to discover which companies do business in that location. Our data is in tabular form, then answering these queries is straightforward.Org NameLocation NameTCSPUNEINFOCEPTPUNEWIPROPUNEAMAZONHYDERABADINTELHYDERABADIf this location data was stored in Python as a list of tuples (entity, relation, entity), then the question “Which organizations operate in HYDERABAD?” could be given as follows:Information Extraction has many applications, including business intelligence, resume harvesting, media analysis, sentiment detection, patent search, and email scanning. A particularly important area of current research involves the attempt to extract structured data out of electronically-available scientific literature, especially in the domain of biology and medicine.Information Extraction ArchitectureThe following figure shows the architecture for Information extraction system.The above system takes the raw text of a document as an input and produces a list of (entity, relation, entity) tuples as its output. For example, given a document that indicates that the company INTEL is in HYDERABAD it might generate the tuple ([ORG: ‘INTEL’] ‘in’ [LOC: ‘ HYDERABAD’]). The steps in the information extraction system are as follows.STEP 1: The raw text of the document is split into sentences using a sentence segmentation.STEP 2: Each sentence is further subdivided into words using tokenization.STEP 3: Each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, named entity detection.STEP 4: In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence.STEP 5: we use relation detection to search for likely relations between different entities in the text.ChunkingThe basic technique that we use for entity detection is chunking which segments and labels multi-token sequences.In the following figure shows the Segmentation and Labelling at both the Token and Chunk Levels, the smaller boxes in it show the word-level tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, while the large boxes show higher-level chunking. Each of these larger boxes is called a chunk. Like tokenization, which omits whitespace, chunking usually selects a subset of the tokens. Also, like tokenization, the pieces produced by a chunker do not overlap in the source text.Noun Phrase ChunkingIn the noun phrase chunking or NP-chunking, we will search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases. For example, here is some Wall Street Journal text with NP-chunks marked using brackets:NP-chunks are often smaller pieces than complete noun phrases.One of the most useful sources of information for NP-chunking is part-of-speech tags.This is one of the inspirations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system. We determine this approach using an example sentence. In order to create an NP-chunker, we will first define a chunk grammar, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular-expression rule. This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (DT) followed by any number of adjectives (JJ) and then a noun (NN). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser and test it on our example sentence. The result is a tree, which we can either print or display graphically.Chunking with Regular ExpressionsTo find the chunk structure for a given sentence, the Regexp Parser chunker starts with a flat structure in which no tokens are chunked. The chunking rules applied in turn, successively updating the chunk structure. Once all the rules have been invoked, the resulting chunk structure is returned. Following simple chunk grammar consisting of two rules. The first rule matches an optional determiner or possessive pronoun, zero or more adjectives, then a noun. The second rule matches one or more proper nouns. We also define an example sentence to be chunked and run the chunker on this input.OUTPUT:chunk.conllstr2tree() Function:A conversion function chunk.conllstr2tree() is used to builds a tree representation from one of these multi-line strings. Moreover, it permits us to choose any subset of the three chunk types to use, here just for NP chunks:SOURCE: https://www.learntek.org/blog/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk/----Mudda Prince--Mudda Prince--Mudda Prince--Mudda Prince--Anil TilbeinLevel Up Coding--Leonie MonigattiinTowards Data Science--13Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Unbecoming--766Nick HemenwayinPython in Plain English--5Joseph Robinson, Ph.D.inTowards Data Science--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Mudda Prince,https://medium.com/@muddaprince456,"8, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*y7fYhwuNsJaXYtrv.png",6,1

You can see more about this here: https://infinity-cable-products.com/blogs/news/difference-between-solid-vs-stranded-copper-cablesPure copper cables are when the conductor wires inside the cables are pure copper.

Now, there is a new way to target the environment around the tumor, which comes from nanobodies naturally produced by free alpacas, camels and llamas. Using this method in mouse models, the researchers successfully inhibited melanoma and colon cancer that currently cannot be treated with CAR-T cell therapy.In 1989, two undergraduates of Free University of Brussels stumbled upon an unknown antibody while testing camel’s frozen serum. It is a miniaturized version of human antibodies and consists of only two heavy chains, not two light chains and two heavy chains. Their final report says the presence of the antibody has been confirmed not only in camels, but also in alpacas and alpacas. Thirty years later, in the PNAS, researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that further reduction of these mini antibodies could create so-called nanobodies. It may help solve the problem in the field of cancer: making CAR-T cell therapy work in solid tumors.Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy through genetic engineering to modify the patient’s own T cells, so that it can better attack cancer cells, which shows a great development prospect for blood tumors. For example, Dana-Farber / Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disease Center is currently using CAR-T cell therapy to treat recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, CAR-T cells still face great challenges in eliminating solid tumors, and it is difficult to find tumor-specific proteins that can be used as safe targets in solid tumors. At the same time, solid tumors are also protected by extracellular matrix, which is a supporting network composed of proteins and acts as a barrier. At the same time, immunosuppressive molecules can also weaken the attack of T cells.Rethinking CAR-T cellsFor two decades, antibody patents have been largely held by Belgium. But that changed after the patent expired in 2013. Dr. Hidde Ploegh, a senior researcher and immunologist at Boston Children and PNAS Research, said: “A lot of people are aware of this field and are beginning to recognize the unique nature of nanobodies. “A useful feature is that they enhance their positioning capabilities. Ploegh of Boston Children’s Hospital and his team, in collaboration with Dr. Noo Jalikhani and Dr. Richard Hynes of the Koch Comprehensive Cancer Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have used nanoparticles to carry imaging agents to accurately visualize metastatic cancer.The Hynes team maked nanobodies target the tumor’s extracellular matrix (ECM), the environment around the cancer, rather than the cancer cell itself. This marker is common in many tumors, but usually does not appear in normal cells. “our laboratory and Hynes laboratory are one of the few laboratories that actively study this method of targeting the tumor microenvironment, and most laboratories are looking for tumor-specific antigens,” Ploegh said.Targeted tumor microenvironmentPloegh and his team targeted factors that make solid tumors difficult to treat and applied the idea to CAR-T cell therapy. They created CAR-T cells filled with nanosomes that recognize specific proteins in the tumor environment and carry signals instructing them to kill any cells that bind to them. One of the proteins, EIIIB, is a variant of fibronectin, which exists only in newly formed blood vessels that provide nutrition for tumors. The other is PD-L1, an immunosuppressive protein that most cancers use to inhibit close T cells.Doctor of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Jessica Ingram, drove to Amherst, Massachusetts, to collect T cells from two alpaca Bryson and Sanchez, inject them with interested antigens and collect blood. Further processed in Boston to produce nanobodies.Treatment of melanoma and colon cancerIt was tested in two independent melanoma mouse models and a colon adenocarcinoma mouse model. CAR-T cells based on nanobodies kill tumor cells, significantly slow down tumor growth, improve the survival rate of animals, and have no obvious side effects.Ploegh believes that engineered T cells work together through a variety of factors. They cause damage to tumor tissue, which often stimulates the inflammatory immune response. Targeted EIIIB may damage blood vessels in a way that reduces tumor blood supply while making them more permeable to cancer drugs. “If you disrupt the local blood supply and cause vascular leakage, it may improve the delivery of other more inaccessible things, and I think we should see this as part of a combination therapy,” Ploegh said.Future development directionPloegh thinks his team’s approach may be useful for many solid tumors. He was particularly interested in testing CAR-T cells based on nanobodies in pancreatic and cholangiocarcinoma models. “Nanobodies may carry a cytokine to enhance the immune response to tumors, such as toxic molecules that kill tumors and radioisotopes that irradiate tumors at close range,” Ploegh said. “CAR-T cells are the vanguard of breaking through the gates and the other elements then complete their mission. In theory, you can equip a T cell with multiple chimeric antigen receptors and achieve higher accuracy, which is what we want to pursue.”----Ivan Chen--Ivan Chen--Ivan Chen--Ivan Chen--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Ivan Chen,https://medium.com/,0,4,0

Back when the PowerPC days were still happening, we had the clamshell iBook, G3 iMacs, G4 iMacs, all that. No one cared that they weren’t very powerful at all 5 years later, just the magic they had at the time.Apple was certainly different back then. Amongst their modern designs, they were also creative designs. Everybody can remember what the G3 iMacs look like. Apple’s skeuomorphic design was very well known, and lasted up to late 2013 until iOS 7 released. Since about 2010 we’ve seen Apple go into a different direction, clean lines and aluminium silver has been the main aesthetic for years now. Compared to their colored plastics of yester-year.Apple was like the outcast back in the late 90’s and early 2000’s. They made strange designs, UIs and had outlandish principles for the time. When every computer felt like something you’d see in a boring office, Apple had the creatives.The tables have now turned though. Apple adapted a cleaner design and UI for all of their products. Now, it’s people like Samsung who are left to make strange devices to stand out in the way that Apple did 20 years ago.I believe Apple still has *some* magic. Mostly in that they’re trendsetters. Looking 2016–2019 Macbook Pros this becomes clear. A few things happened with these model years. First was that they were so clean, thin and relatively powerful, which has since been a huge thing manufacturers go for, second was USB C charging, and an emphasis on USB C / Thunderbolt.Their past magic is also gone though. With problems flooding the 2016–2019 Macbooks they don’t have the same “it just works” mentality behind them. From screen cables flexing and breaking, unreliable hardware, throttling on the I9 models, and only having USB C / 3.5mm, they don’t seem to be the same strong laptops they used to be. Of course you still have the same reasons to buy an older MBP that you have had for years — better trackpads, batteries, screens, keyboards, relative upgrade ability etc while remaining useful even 6 years later when it comes to the 2012 models. But this new gen of Macbooks just aren’t as strong. It seems the only Macbook that *doesn’t* have a problem is the 2015 Macbook Air that’s still being sold for $1,000 (their cheapest Macbook). Though that isn’t to say the 2018 Macbook Air is a bad laptop, it’s actually one of my favorite laptops to recommend to people looking for laptops.My conclusion would be more that their magic has changed to an aesthetic than anything. Apple isn’t a dead brand, I expect them to still be a trendsetter and strong manufacturer for years to come. I stand by most of what I said in my “In Defense of Apple” article and previous articles pertaining to Macs and Apple, they’re a strong, high quality brand with their issues.----Hello!

The differences between these boards and Seeed’s offering is most notable in the price difference, with the Arch Mix retailing for $29.90 (available now), while the others will set you back $90 and up.Beyond the I.MX RT1052, the Arch Mix is equipped with 1X USB 2.0 (Host), 1X USB 2.0 (OTG), a pair of 22-pin headers (RMII, CAN, I2C, UART, CSI, etc.), boot config DIP switch, and 24-bit RGB LCD interface. It also features a micro SD card slot, RTC 3V battery connector, several buttons (on/off, reset, user), and power/user LEDs.The Arch Mix is said to be well-suited for industrial control, smart buildings, automation and process control, human-machine interfaces, as well as robotics.

Just try to imagine a world without light…sounds extremely dull (pun intended).We wouldn’t be able to see colours, see stars in the sky or or stay up till 3 am reading a book (guilty of this many times):sweat_smile:.I wouldn’t even be able to write this article without having light illuminate the graphic interface on my computer screen.The sense of seeing wouldn’t exist without light traveling about 300 000 000 m/s and providing us real-time data about our environment that is reflected in our eyes then interpreted by the occipital lobe in the back of our brains. We would have 4 senses instead of 5! It makes me wonder what a 6th sense could allow us to understand about existence and matter in the universe. What higher version of reality are we unable to ever conceive of without a sense to measure it? Okayyyy I’ll stop here before I turn this into a science fiction book, but you get the point. Life would suck without light.There is another concept that I want to convey, the importance of focus. Our brains are constantly being bombarded by information every millisecond, it’s surprising how we can even manage to navigate life in such a complex environment. Evolution is definitely to thank for that, but light is constantly entering our eyes and we need to be able to focus the input load to definitively see objects clearly.Euclid (famous mathematician) pondered about human vision and hypothesized that our eyes sent out focused rays of light onto external objects which were reflected back into our eyes to allow for human sight. He was close, turns out our eyes don’t have superman laser vision but light can be compartmentalized into focused rays that enter our eye and be understood by our brain.So being able to focus light is an important skill needed to see the world around us. The idea of light being packaged into focused lasers is vital in understanding the idea of optical tweezers, lasers are the essence of this article.Our eyes no matter how great they are, will always be limited to size and distance of the objects it can see. We cannot see far into outer space without a telescope nor can we see nanoscale objects without a microscope.This means that in these specific environments we cannot use the sense of sight to collect data and understand the complex system. Without technology we would have remained blind to whole ecosystems of the microscopic world. This is crazy because on our bodies alone we host over 100 trillion microbes which is more than or about the same number of human cells.Without the capability of understanding through observation it’s extremely hard to conceptualize the role of the micro-biome in our bodies and how bacterias aid/harm our health. So many chronic diseases now stem from the micro-biome in our gut and the foods we eat but without the aid of technology we can never truly understand the role they play.Our everyday life is very strongly affected by the nanoscale world that’s out of reach from our basic senses. Using optical tweezers we can leverage the technology to understand biology of the microscopic life living everywhere around us.It will allow us to give a deeper depth of vision and also tactile ability to study and manipulate small particles.“What is the fundamental question of cell biology? It’s the fundamental question of life.” ~ UnknownWith this innovation we can now use the technology to understand the minute details of how life works on the nanoscale and provide answers to larger problems about the origins of life and death.One of the biggest questions we still don’t have the answer to is, what are the different stages of cell’s life?THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.It’s like saying that humans go from babies → adolescence → adult → old age and then die without knowing the phases and transitions between each stage of life.We need to know all the variations and details of a cell’s life to detect abnormalities when diseases, mutations, cancers, etc. start to occur.Think of each cell like a teenager, undergoing the transition from a child to an adult is a difficult one and many times very stressful. We want to know how much stress a child is under to help make the transition happen smoothly. The outcomes of extreme cases are seen when students are left undiagnosed and suicide rates go up. This issue is as serious on the cellular level as it is in our society. Cells that are left undiagnosed grow into tumours and mutate which become dangerous for our health.Light is able to move matter because the energy in photons has momentum. This means that it exerts a force on the object it interacts with, a laser pointed towards you also pushes you away however the amount of force is so little that it’s negligible and has close to no effect. However, for particles on the nanoscale, the amount of energy in a laser has enough momentum to push the particles away.The laser is a gaussian beam, meaning the structure of the laser will have the brightest concentrated light in the middle and the tail ends will have least. To hold the particle in place this distribution of light is necessary. In the middle of the laser a small glass ball is placed with lower refractive index so the light passing through will be refracted. On this ball you can attach the specimen you are observing.The brighter beam of light will create net force upwards with it’s momentum because light is refracted unequally according to the gaussian profile. However with conservation of momentum there be an equal and opposite force applied to the object which brings the glass ball back to the middle. This indefinitely keeps a hold of the particles and can measure the amount of movement a specimen is causing, i.e. if a bacteria creates movement away from the optical trap in laser. The laser will act like a spring and pull the object back into middle, successfully having a hold over it.Light being used is infrared as to not kill bacteria or cells under the radiation. This optical trap helps hold onto nanoscale objects and observe them for long periods of time. You can also move these particles as you move the whole laser beam with the glass ball in an optical trap which will also move with the direction of the laser.Here is a breakdown of how this technology works, refer to the figure 1.Optical tweezers are a technology which will help observe nanoscale objects when our eyes can’t, move and manipulate them in different environments and unlock the mysteries of biological processes.Remember how I told you light was really important? Yup, this is just a mind-blowing application, it can literally allow us the ability to understand nanoscale objects. Still giving us the sense of sight even when the frame of reference is past our visual limitations.Thank you for reading my article!

332,43645,https://medium.com/@julia_sheehy/long-rant-45e6ebd8806d?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,<LONG RANT>,None,"Julia SheehyFollow--ListenShareI began to work early that morning at the library. Soon after I arrived the Director said there had been an incident, go set up the conference room. I felt physically sick as various devices nearby me fed the radio news in, realizing I would know people hurt, firefighters deployed, and people still active-duty getting scrambled to fly or stand alert.We saw the image of the first aircraft collision being replayed on the TV in the Margaret Mair Conference Room of Marist College’s Cannavino Library where the college President, Board Members, and Deans/Cabinet members gathered.Sadly a person in charge of an e-commerce effort there then kept turning the display unit in the conference room off and on, thinking they were helping. People were extremely upset by the interruption. Just as I got the live-feed stable (sometimes, when I am less angry, I regret getting nasty with the administrator borking the equipment) we watched together in shocked silence as the second plane struck.That sick feeling grew deeper and lasted for weeks. It returns a while before the anniversary every year.By 10:00 AM I was torn in three ways: between wanting to MAKE everyone stop everything and watch the news, and wanting to fetch my young son from school to be with him for a moment of desperate gratitude, and wanting to run away entirely.Trains down to NYC many months later still had a certain dank odor that reminded me of the tires and debris burning in pits alongside the highway from Riyadh Air Base in Saudi Arabia to our quarters at Eskan Village. Everything felt heavy and dark for a very long time.I remember questioning everything about my life even more than I had been wont to before: how I was living, what was I contributing, what world would my son inherit? It has been tumultuous for the nearly two decades since.The difference is that now I no longer want to run away.I might suffer bitterly again, I might even have suicidal ideation, but I will endure. I believe there is a life after this one and the lessons my soul needs to learn now is the most important work I get to do.I’m not in charge of anyone else’s life, I can’t make people watch a variety of news outlets. However, whenever I want to express love and gratitude for a family member or friend now — I just do it. Compassion is not weakness. Gratitude is not wrong.I am unhappy by the exhortation to “Never Forget”: WE FORGOT that we are under attack always (please don’t bombard me with the message that this is simply a negative mindset and we need only agitate for peace to cause the threat to dissipate. I read too many intel reports and attended too many intelligence briefings to doubt the threat), we FORGOT where the real threat is (not Mexico), and WE FORGOT what our nation does best when we put trivial differences aside and focus on principles instead of personalities.We forgot our best selves and willfully engaged in the cult of personality by electing an unethical profiteering, undisciplined, lascivious, gluttonous celebrity as our Command in Chief. Enough nonsense.If you still think President Trump represents “conservative values” your cognition is sorely compromised and you refuse to hear facts suggesting that your cognitive dissonance has progressed to a degree worthy of medical diagnosis. I can only pray you will recover critical thinking skills before leaving this life.Never Forget? Terrorists must laugh with glee as we inflict pain on the weakest while our POTUS and his handlers infect our national dialog with racism, spreading fear of brown people — some most recently forced to flee the devastation of Hurricane Dorian.Never Forget? Bullshit. Some of the masterminds behind the attack on 9–11 were from Saudi Arabia. The Taliban have often aided Al Quaeda and yet our POTUS wanted to invite them to Camp David!?!?!?! Hideous fool in power, and we are his sheep. I am preaching just to the choir as the “only consume happy stuff” club of self-delusion will not read this.Fuck the empty vanities and posturing of “Never Forget” → donate to hurricane relief efforts, welcome people of different faiths into the community, treat people of color with respect, treat women as actual human beings, and stop doubting that God/a higher power/human ingenuity will find a way to make sure we still have enough food and water and housing.I still question everything. My inability to stop thinking has at times been near crippling. Still, as much anyone might judge my endless thinking, or might ridicule my addiction to “dwelling on the meaning of things “— know this: I prefer this painful awareness without the opiate of denial and other distractions. I enjoy the blessings of this life without needing to blot out the guilt of my privilege.I don’t deny that our nation makes serious mistakes. I assert the right to love my nation fiercely while expressing dissent. I don’t want to simply “remember” it is not enough to “never forget”. I never want another assault on our nation. I never want war on our soil. Our enemies thwart dissent, treat people like objects and do not value education. Our enemies want a theocracy and a world where women are not functionally literate.Without respectful dissent in our nation, we run the risk of becoming like our enemy.----Julia Sheehy--Julia Sheehy--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Julia Sheehy,https://medium.com/@julia_sheehy,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2J_qCgP2_s2UC8Z4Hr0vsw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*39E5RxeA14PlJTr8yu8Y-A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ekEhT8XY3uB_1ciscGezfw.png",5,272

334,13396,https://medium.com/@UlordChain/uos-tutorial-what-are-ram-cpu-and-net-c6e9e500d532?source=tag_archive---------125-----------------------,"UOS Tutorial | What are RAM, CPU, and NET?",None,"UlordFollow--ListenShareOn February 26, UOS, the Ulord sidechain was launched and caught the widely attention. This article mainly explains some details of CPU, NET, and RAM resources. It will not make you disappointed after reading.I. What is UOS?It is a second sidechain based on Ulord. It uses the DPoS consensus protocol to get a million-level TPS. UOS has strong compatibility with EOS. UOS consensus mechanism prevents the mutual voting between the consensus masternodes; UOS adds a penalty mechanism to prevent nodes from doing evil. UOS lowers the technical threshold to promote the blockchain application.All Tokens on the UOS chain are generated from the UT exchange. UOS will not appear or disappear suddenly. The exchange ratio of UOS and UT is 1:1.II. Three resources of UOSAt present, there are three main resources in the UOS system: network bandwidth resource (NET), CPU computing resource (CPU), and running memory resource (RAM).RAM originally refers to computer memory. In the UOS system, RAM is the main memory space of the UOS system occupied by the storage account data.CPU originally refers to the central processing unit of computer. In the UOS system, CPU refers to the time required for the UOS system to process the operation instructions.NET originally refers to a computer network. In the UOS system, NET is the size of data transmitted in the UOS system.In summary, RAM is the storage resource occupied by the account, CPU is the computing power occupied by the operation instruction, and NET is the network resource occupied by the operation instruction.For example:Bob is a technology geek, and he is very optimistic about the prospects of UOS. He wants to develop a DApp on UOS. To develop DApp, he must have RAM resources to deploy contracts.If you want to transfer money to another account, the UOS system handles your transfer instructions and assumes that it takes 1ms. It is necessary to mortgage UOS in advance to get at least 1ms of CPU.Meanwhile, the transfer instructions you send are also data, and it needs the UOS network resources. If it is 1KB, you must mortgage UOS in advance to exchange at least 1KB of NET.III. The ways to get these 3 resourcesRAM is forever occupied and not recoverable. It needs to be purchased with UOS, and can be used permanently after purchase.To realize the market configuration of RAM, the price of RAM adopts the Bancor algorithm, and its price is determined by the supply and demand relationship of the market. The more people buy, the higher the price. In this way, it ensures the liquidity of RAM resources.UOS RAM price inquiry: https://explorer.uosio.org/CPU and NET are one-time use. You have to mortgage UOS for exchange, and they are not directly charged. Take CPU for example:CPU adopts a proportional system, and allocates CPU according to the proportion of the user’s UOS mortgage amount to the total mortgage amount. For example, if there are 100 UOS on the whole network for obtaining the use right of CPU, then one UOS will get 1% of the total computing resources of the entire network. CPU and NET are always in a state of slow recovery. If CPU is completely worn out, it will be fully restored the next day if the mortgage is unchanged.IV. How to get these three resources of UOSFirst, you should use Ulord (APP) to register your UOS account. The UOS account is your pass + ID + wallet in the UOS world.The UOS account is neither a private key nor a public key, but a 12-bit string bound to the private key and the public key. For example, the account number is: xiaomishuabc.The benefits of this account system like UOS is easy to remember, easy to use and safe.To be specific, you need to purchase RAM or mortgage CPU and NET through UOS in Ulord.Click the Add Wallet button to enter the UOS Wallet Creation interface.PS: You must have a UT wallet with balance to create a UOS wallet.2. Click the activation code to create a UOS account.PS: According to the Ulord official news, the activation code is issued daily with a limited amount, and each ID can only create one UOS account. It is necessary to create a UOS account early.3. Enter the wallet name and password to click Wallet.4. Enter the account name as required, click to get the activation code and create a UOS account.5. The wallet was created successfully and backed up.6. Exchange UOS7.

336,34808,https://medium.com/@heitkamp/diversifying-tech-76a9db04032b?source=tag_archive---------79-----------------------,Diversifying Tech,Does tech just need to get more diverse or should we also rethink what tech is to make it more inclusive of diversity?,"Steve HeitkampFollow--ListenShareNot long ago tech companies tried to attract talent by out geeking each other, parading nerdy young guys as the world’s new superheroes. Over the past 10 years, however, diversity and inclusion have come to be valued by even the least diverse tech companies. In the past 5 years companies have started publishing data on how effective they are at actually becoming more diverse and inclusive.Despite these significant changes, efforts have plateaued, at least as evidenced by company diversity data. Some blame pipelines (not enough diversity in STEM) and others say it is about retaining diverse talent. Most everyone agrees that increasing diversity and inclusion at tech companies is a complex and multifaceted challenge.Yet, in a space where failure is a right of passage and iteration and pivoting are norms, few people are questioning the roles that exist at tech companies. It is assumed that tech companies are mostly Engineering + Sales (or Tech + Business). But as consumers and legislators start to ask how companies are leveraging user data and the frailties of systems built only to optimize clicks and ad sales are exposed, it might be time to think more broadly about the roles a tech company needs to have.Maybe it is time for tech companies to start hiring for data ethicists, human empowerment specialists, and even product and data compliance officers. Some companies are already doing this: Lever has Trust & User Operations Associates, Indiegogo has Customer Success Managers, and Clover Health has Data Stewards. These companies also happen to be some of the most diverse and inclusive within tech.This role diversification will require new hiring pipelines, broadening the hiring pool, and bring in new ways of thinking about technology. Combined this could help to create positive feedback loops that improve diversity and inclusion in tech while also helping tech companies better prepare for evolving expectations from regulators and customers alike.This won’t ‘solve for’ diversity and inclusion in tech and is not an alternative to efforts to increase diversity specifically within technical roles, but it may help to break down the challenge differently while also helping to build tech companies that are more thoughtful about the diverse communities they want to serve.While not all tech companies value diversity equally, today most of them at least support the idea that diversity within tech is desirable. In the UK, for example, many companies take the legal requirement to publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap as an opportunity to emphasize their commitment to all things diversity.A cynic might ask how many of these companies submitted reports prior to the requirement. I think we can all guess the answer: not (m)any.Setting cynicism aside, however, the increase in public affirmations that diversity and inclusion are valuable is a step in the right direction, even if it only a very small step on a very long path. As Megan Rose Dickey wrote in a recent TechCrunch article on The Future of Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, just over 10 years ago questioning the Silicon Valley old boys club was seen as risky. Today it is welcome.More recently, when I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2015 the idea of publishing diversity reports and basic data was seen as pretty cutting edge for tech companies. Google, for example, first began publishing a Diversity Annual Report in 2014. And GoDaddy, which had previously made a name for itself through a series of truly nauseating ads, was getting a lot of press for its efforts to transform itself from one of the most toxic and least diverse and inclusive tech companies around to one of the most diverse and inclusive companies.Of course, diversity reports were great for companies because they could control the narrative, focusing their publications on all the things they were doing to develop a more diverse organization, and only releasing the data that they wanted to for the story they hoped to tell.The UK Gender Pay Gap reporting requirements mean that companies lose some ability to control the narrative. Having to publish metrics on diversity helps everyone to better understand where companies are and how they are progressing (or regressing) in their attempts to increase diversity and inclusion.If all the diversity and inclusion programs highlighted in company diversity reports are not improving the data, then they are clearly not the (only) solution.Looking at the data companies have been compelled to release rather than just what they wanted to release — specifically 2017 to 2018 UK gender pay gap data — reveals that year over year there was little progress in closing the gender pay gap across organizations (all industries), and that any progress is incremental at best.In an article in HR Magazine on the UK gender pay gap data, Rachel Sharp wrote, “Nearly four-fifths (78%) of companies had a pay gap in favour of men, an exact repeat of the 2017 figure reported last year. At almost half (45%) of organisations the gender pay gap actually widened further in favour of men.”Within tech, many companies say this is less about pay discrimination than it is about uneven representation — the people in the roles that pay the most, such as Engineering and Senior Management, lack diversity. So, if the gap is more a reflection of representation than pay discrepancies for the same work, the question then is, “How can we increase representation?”Atlassian, one of the more active and vocal tech companies in support of diversity and inclusion, recently published a commissioned Report on the State of Diversity and Inclusion in U.S. Tech that found, “Despite massive amounts of attention and discussion about diversity and inclusion, the tech industry is still not making progress. The question is, why?”As highlighted in the report, and in other writings, there are many reasons why the diversity and inclusion numbers are plateauing for most companies.Some of the challenges in improving diversity and inclusion stem from more systemic undervaluing of the realities of people who fall outside of what Caroline Criado Perez describes, in her excellent book, Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias In A World Designed For Men, as the “default male”. These realities include bias in urban transportation planning, failure to recognize and appreciate unpaid work, norms around appropriate works hours, the myth of meritocracy in the face of (un)conscious bias, and on.Others are more specific to tech where the default is not just male, but also tends to be young, technical, geeky, and contrarian.Some companies, however, have gone beyond valuing diversity and inclusion, viewing it as a nice thing to have, to treating it as a strategic imperative. Companies like Lever, Indiegogo, and Clover Health built diversity and inclusion into their company DNA and are leading the charge within tech companies.While these companies and ones like them are doing a lot of things right, in looking at their websites I couldn’t help but notice both how they are presenting themselves and the roles they are hiring for. They are not just looking for diverse candidates, they are creating diverse roles. These roles are distinct from most tech companies and anchored off of inclusivity, collaboration, and empathy.As of writing Indiegogo, for example, has a Trust & User Operations Associate opening and they are looking for people described as, “passionate about helping people and problem solving. You are empathetic yet efficient, articulate, patient, and creative”. They are a tech company seeking people who are passionate about helping people, empathetic, and patient. Further, looking at their career page they describe themselves as “Empowerment, Inc.”On their career page Clover Health practically shouts, “Clover is hiring people who care.” They reiterate this in specific job postings and most begin with some version of, “We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. Healthcare is a universal concern, and we need people with different backgrounds and experiences to help us build the future.”As noted in their Diversity & Inclusion at Clover Health: 2018 Update:“Many companies talk about the business benefits of diversity: different perspectives coming together to create better products and results for their customers. Here at Clover, this can literally be a matter of life and death. Healthcare touches everyone, so we need employees with different work experiences, backgrounds, and points of view to effectively solve the complex problems faced in Medicare.”These ideals are present even in areas of the company, such as IT, where one might expect diversity to be slightly less critical to the business. As an example, Clover’s IT group is (as of writing) is hiring for a Data Steward, which is a role focused on collaboration between business and IT and where facilitation and customer service are highlighted as reasons why someone might love the job. Perhaps more interestingly, the “get in touch if” skills begin with a focus on health and managed care before shifting to the more ‘technical’ aspects of the job, such as “strong knowledge and experience with relational and dimensional databases”.In addition to being “product focused” and willing to “embrace difficult problems”, which are both fairly standard ideas within tech companies, Lever notes, “We care about cross-functional empathy (XFE!). We think the best companies are built when different teams have a shared understanding of each others goals and values.”The roles they are hiring for include Customer Success Managers and a Manager of Customer Success, both part of the Customer Advocacy team described as at, “the intersection between our products and our customers — we’re the advocates that help inform product decisions based on customer feedback”.Looking at the roles within most tech companies, however, and in job listings more broadly, little of this role diversity is present. A recent report from Glassdoor on the roles within tech inadvertently highlights the general lack of diversity in tech roles:When we think of employees at tech companies, what usually comes to mind are software engineers and data scientists — people with technical skills such as coding and machine learning. But, tech companies aren’t solely hiring for tech roles. They are hiring non-tech workers as well. In today’s job market, you no longer have to be a tech worker to work in tech.While this may sound promising, the non-technical Job Titles reveal that this is less an evolution in tech than a simple reflection that tech companies are not just tech, but also companies. As such, they have Sales, Marketing, and Operations personnel as well.Moreover, the listing of tech roles reaffirms that the focus for most companies is on the tech, not how the tech empowers (or not) humans. While this does make sense — we are talking about tech companies — as Lever, Indiegogo, and others have shown, tech companies are doing more than building and selling products. They transforming how humans interact with the world and with each other. The roles required to ensure that this transformation enhances human experience extend well beyond engineering, sales, and marketing.So, perhaps it is time for tech companies more generally to reconsider the roles that exist within their organizations. Role diversification is one of the clearest indicators that a company more than values diversity and inclusion, but actually sees it as a strategic priority. It is also a clear indication that a company is doing more than just selling products to users, but actually empowering humans in diverse and inclusive ways.This change would probably be good for increasing diversity and inclusion at tech companies. It would also probably be good for us humans more broadly.----Empowering humans to better use data and avoid being used by it. Hence Co-Founder. Angel investor. Palantir Alum.

338,44681,https://medium.com/@josungjoon/new-adventure-at-d20-capital-culmination-of-a-nonlinear-path-95675a79b373?source=tag_archive---------16-----------------------,New adventure at D20 Capital: The culmination of a nonlinear journey,None,"Sungjoon ChoFollow--ListenShareLast month, I started a new role as a General Partner at D20 Capital, an investment firm based in San Francisco that is backed by Doosan Group. D20’s mandate is to invest in innovation that is revolutionizing traditional industries, starting with construction and manufacturing — industries where Doosan has a strong global presence via affiliates like Bobcat and Doosan Infracore.D20 Capital is yet another bold bet for Doosan. Enabled by support from both top management and the founding family, hard earned capital is being committed from a capital intensive business. D20’s independent mandate and streamlined decision-making processes represent Doosan’s willingness to sacrifice control in return for success. Operating as an independent VC firm will enable us to back brilliant entrepreneurs who are pursuing tech driven innovation in old world industries, via both capital and the might of a leading conglomerate.So how did I end up at an investment firm in Silicon Valley backed by a Korean conglomerate?Since my first day as an engineering freshman at the University of Illinois 19 years ago (!!), my career path has been highly non-linear — a scatter plot of sorts whether based on geography, organizational size, or operational mandate. The irony is that those closest to me will attest that my personality leans more towards stability seeking than adventurous. Despite that, it turns out that D20 is my 7th job, and D20 represents a culmination of my various journeys. A full circle.A bullet point version of my path thus far to illustrate this point:- Electrical Engineering undergrad at UIUC: I spent my 4 years as an undergrad assuming that I was destined to get a PHD in EE and become a professor. Perhaps because my heart wasn’t set on it, I took classes in various engineering disciplines. Dabbling, more than specializing. I did write a thesis in the field of power electronics — a field that was considered a bit stale back then, but now critical due to the rise of battery powered vehicles and devices. The natural next step was a Master’s in EE in the U.S…- Master’s in EE at Seoul National University: In an 11th hour decision, I decided to go to Korea to get my M.S. I was advised that if I ever want to be a professor in Korea, it’d be good to have some roots in Korea and to establish a network. I learned how to succeed in a purely Korean organization and learned the technology of millimeter wave radio-frequency sensors — a topic that was somewhat niche back then but is now very hot due to the rapidly rising potential of autonomous vehicles. The natural next step was to continue my research in a PHD program…- PM at Samsung Electronics: In another 11th hour decision, I decided to scrap my plans towards academia. In the extensive research and thesis writing process, I realized that becoming highly specialized in a field was not for me. There are certain people who thrive in digging deep, in perpetually asking ‘why’ and in evaluating problems from a myriad of different angles. That wasn’t me. It took me >6 years to realize that, and I joined Samsung Electronics as a product manager in the mobile processor team that would go on to produce the ‘brains’ of the first iPhones and Galaxy smartphones. In this process, I learned an immense amount about how large organizations work, and how individuals working in dozens of small teams can collectively create products that were minor technology miracles. My broad interactions with startups also piqued my interest in venture capital for the first time as I noticed the difference in ‘swagger’ between startups with lots of funding vs. those living on the edge. The natural next step was to rise up the Samsung Electronics corporate ladder…- Executive Staff for JY Lee: I received a call at my desk one day and was politely asked to go to headquarters in Seoul to interview. I asked what the interview was for and when they wouldn’t tell me, I declined. One stern call and many interviews later, I found myself in the office of JY Lee, then Vice Chairman and now de facto head of Samsung Group. I learned at the highest level about the reach and power of a large conglomerate along with the intricacies of powerful business families.- MBA at Columbia: I went to business school aspiring to land a position in venture capital in the U.S. My aspiration was quickly shot down by friends and mentors who wisely advised that my background gave me no competitive advantage in breaking into the tiny world of venture capital. The pragmatist that I am, I put the VC dream on hold and chose investment banking as the learning experience that would set me up for VC down the road. And then in another hard pivot, I realized that my personality meshed much better with consultants and found myself recruiting for consulting jobs.- Consultant at McKinsey: I was one of very few associates who actually enjoyed the job. I worked on really interesting projects such as a massive capital deployment project at a large semiconductor factory, a leading telco’s acquisition fueled growth strategy, and a large tech merger. I had horse-blinders on in positioning myself to make partner. While some of my peers discussed ‘exit strategy’ from the world of consulting, I turned down recruiter calls as I knew that the McKinsey career progression was what I wanted to do…- VC at Formation 8/Formation Group: I was contacted by Formation 8, which at that time the media dubbed as ‘the hottest VC since Andreessen.’ Was this really happening? After folding on my VC aspirations just four years prior, this opportunity had fallen on my lap. I moved from NYC to SF and quickly learned about the world of startups and venture capital. My experience after joining the firm was bumpy, and a partnership with a promising lineup of funds with collectively ~$1.5B in AUM, quickly dissolved. But at the end of the day I learned about a certain way of investing, had the privilege of partnering with many talented entrepreneurs, quickly expanded my previously limited network in Silicon Valley, and also learned about the world of Limited Partners and raising capital.- VC at Amasia: In the process of the unfortunate ending of the Formation 8 experience, a mentor I frequently sought out was Ramanan Raghavendran, a VC industry veteran and a founding General Partner at Amasia. And so when Ramanan and John asked me to join them on their journey, I jumped at the opportunity. At Amasia, I learned about the importance of prudent investing and the levers to do so via valuation sensitivity, capital pacing, and capital efficiency. I also learned from a seasoned investor, who has been through both the dotcom bust and the great recession, the vital importance of fiduciary duty and ethics. I also learned about the immense potential, as well as the nuanced challenges, of bridging Silicon Valley innovation with large Asian markets.Through this meandering journey, I’ve accumulated the learnings and experiences conducive to helping build D20 Capital. I’ve been at two Silicon Valley VC firms with extremely different investing styles: one with a General Partner with very limited experience and one with a General Partner with almost 30 years of investing experience. I’ve been a part of a new VC firm being set up and a successful VC firm shutting down. I’ve pitched to countless fund investors (LPs) and have been pitched to by countless startups. I’ve spent massive amounts of time and energy trying to help U.S. startups in Asia and Asian startups in the U.S. I’ve worked shoulder to shoulder with Fortune 100 C-level execs in the U.S. as a consultant and in Korea as an executive staffer. I’ve also been in the trenches with engineers in building a highly complex semiconductor product. I’ve worked in Seoul, New York, and now the SF Bay Area and in the process have gotten deep into power electronics, radio-frequency engineering, semiconductors, operating systems, SaaS, virtual reality, media, and payments.A common question one is asked in any industry, but perhaps a bit more in venture capital, is ‘what is the best path to get into this industry?’ There has been much discourse, ranging from ‘you must have been an operator’ to ‘the easiest way is investment banking.’ The thinking I respect the most is from Fred Wilson’s post on the ‘Investor VCs and Operator VCs’ — ‘there is no right way.’ I’ve always answered that my path has been non-linear and not the path to emulate in pursuing a career as a VC. At times I’ve felt behind to those who have been lifers in my industry. But there are clearly merits, and perhaps a strong need, for investors with diverse backgrounds. In his new book, Range, David Epstein makes the case for certain advantages that generalists like me have vs. the specialist that I aspired to be 20 years ago. In particular, Epstein writes about research from Philip Tetlock, the renowned researcher on the subject of forecasting. Here, ‘foxes’ are generalists and ‘hedgehogs’ are specialists:In Tetlock’s twenty-year study, both foxes and hedgehogs were quick to update their beliefs after successful predictions, by reinforcing them even more strongly. When an outcome took them by surprise, however, foxes were much more likely to adjust their ideas. Hedgehogs barely budged. Some hedgehogs made authoritative predictions that turned out wildly wrong, and then updated their theories in the wrong direction. They became even more convinced of the original beliefs that led them astray. “Good judges are good belief updaters,” according to Tetlock. If they make a bet and lose, they embrace the logic of a loss just as they would the reinforcement of a win. That is called, in a world: learning. Sometimes it involves putting experience aside entirely.VCs emphasize ‘pattern matching’ and ‘muscle memory.’ This has certainly worked out extremely well for many investors out there. But in this rapidly evolving world of technology, there are undoubtedly uncharted waters as new technologies arise, the world gets smaller, and technology penetration accelerates in industries slow to adopt tech innovation. We collectively as a team have a lot to learn and a lot to build. We’ll make investments in entrepreneurs who make us look good, and we’ll also make mistakes. When we do, hopefully we’ll have enough diversity of thought to update our theories in the right direction. I’m excited for the journey that lies ahead for D20 Capital — it will inevitably be non-linear, but undoubtedly we’ll learn a ton from being in the trenches with passionate entrepreneurs pursuing ambitious innovations.----VC Investor at D20 Capital.

340,41086,https://medium.com/expedite-weekly/still-delivering-293de3f719b?source=tag_archive---------104-----------------------,8.27.2019: Still Delivering…,None,"Kristen HawleyFollowExpedite--ListenShareIt wasn’t my intention to focus so intently on digital ordering and delivery in Expedite’s early days, but here we are. Week three and counting.A little more than a year after launching nationwide delivery, Panera is calling in reinforcements to generate more business for its delivery channel. The casual dining chain announced today that it is partnering with the big three third-party delivery services in the U.S. — Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats — to fire up more demand for lunch and dinner delivery orders. (For now, Panera is keeping breakfast delivery to itself.)Panera fulfills the deliveries via white-label logistics system Bringg, the company confirmed, so the partnership with the third-party services is largely a marketing play to reach a wider consumer audience. It doesn’t hurt that the company can side step the bulk of third-party delivery commission fees with this setup, either.“Because they’re providing their own logistics, they likely cut their commissions in half or more,” said Scott Landers, founder of Figure 8 Logistics, a food delivery consulting firm based in New York City. “Typically a 20 percent commission can be broken down to 10 percent marketing and 10 percent delivery. This means they’re likely paying no more than 10 percent and probably as low as 7.5 percent due to their purchasing power and brand.”In making this move, Panera is following a strategic playbook similar to other nationwide chains like Chipotle and McDonald’s. Court one service to white label (more on that in a second) the delivery logistics, but don’t let that stop you from selling delivery wherever the people want to buy it.- Erika AdamsExpedite contributor Erika Adams is a Brooklyn-based freelance restaurant reporter.While plenty of restaurants are eschewing exclusivity contracts with third-party ordering and delivery services (see: UberEats/McDonalds), others are quietly enhancing their relationship to a delivery company with a white-labeled mobile app or website integration.What does that mean?In short, it means when it looks like you’re ordering directly from a restaurant — from that restaurant’s dedicated app or on its website, for example — your order is actually powered by one of the big digital delivery companies. DoorDash and Grubhub in particular are clear on the importance of this feature to their businesses. White labeling can take several forms, from powering the logistics part of the delivery — DoorDash has a whole product devoted to this called DoorDash Drive — to actually building mobile apps and restaurant websites to facilitate delivery. This is also a big part of the reason Grubhub paid $390 million for LevelUp, which is mostly known as a loyalty and payments company — it also creates white-labeled digital properties for restaurants.White labeling in this form isn’t meant to be some secret endeavor, but it can be surprising information to those with a linear view of restaurant delivery, believing the business is more black and white: either you order from the restaurant directly or you order via a third-party marketplace. Nope, not always!Wait, what? Why?The big companies get some things very right, including infrastructure and fulfillment logistics. Many restaurants, from small independent locations to larger chains (“enterprise businesses” is what the industry calls them) don’t have the resources to devote to building a complex digital product that interfaces with real-life delivery logistics. And, truthfully, even if they did, why bother when a host of other options are available?Just like restaurant delivery is not zero-sum, nor are the avenues by which a restaurant or restaurant chain can offer ordering and delivery. There are plenty of ways to do it, and plenty of ways to find success.Some are clear about branded partnerships, like Taco Bell’s delivery with Grubhub. You can’t miss the co-branded experience , really, online or in television ads.For others, the online ordering and delivery experience is restaurant-first, like Chipotle’s in-app partnership with DoorDash. KFC, an exclusive Grubhub partner thanks to parent company Yum Brands’ exclusive deal a couple years ago, “expects to launch a branded web experience by year end” according to Yum CEO Greg Creed. (“Branded web experience” just means a way for customers to order via the KFC website without being redirected to Grubhub.)Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney has confirmed that Grubhub is building KFC’s mobile app on a few of the company’s recent earnings calls, though he defers to Yum Brands when alluding to its eventual release.Why is it a good idea?Simple: brand recognition and loyalty. Chipotle, for example, prompts app users to register for its (new-ish) loyalty program when placing a delivery order within the app. Thanks to LevelUp, Grubhub offers loyalty services too, including targeted marketing campaigns, to those placing digital orders on its platform.While third parties can provide incremental lifts in business, they’re also, at their core, marketplaces. So: it behooves restaurants to continue to invest in creating and maintaining a loyal customer base. According to recent data from Second Measure, customers are becoming less loyal to particular ordering platforms over time — likely a symptom of growth and consumer recognition of newer companies.So… why doesn’t every restaurant white label online ordering?In short, it doesn’t make sense for all businesses. Ordering and delivery services can be good marketing engines for all restaurants, but especially smaller businesses working to get noticed in a competitive market. I mean, look at Panera, which publicly eschewed large third-party services for years. Even Pizza Hut uses Grubhub to take some orders. (The pizza chain still uses its own delivery fleet, a la Panera.)The point: delivery is touted as providing incremental growth. It’s also pricey and time-consuming, and restaurant businesses are still iterating on different formulas to see what works. Increasingly, business models say partnering with a larger company is fruitful, whether for a small business or national chain.-KH----ExpediteFood / tech / wine / funKristen Hawley--1Kristen HawleyinExpedite--Kristen HawleyinExpedite--Kristen HawleyinExpedite--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Kristen Hawley,https://medium.com/@kh,0,4,4

Why did you do an internship in your first semester/year?,"Pratyush ChoudhuryFollow--ListenShareBeing a fourth-year engineering student has its own set of perks. You’ve gone through the grueling three years of college and hopefully, would have explored several different things over this course of time. And juniors being juniors (the curious lot) wish to extract all the information they can.While I advocate the thought process and have done it through my formative years in college, being on the other side, now I’m able to better understand the limitations of being a senior — my time is limited and my priorities have taken the driver’s seat.Hence, I tried to work a middle way here. I have taken all the common FAQs I’m asked and have drafted it into a post so it helps a larger pool, saving me time in the process.The following are some of the most frequently asked questions I receive from juniors.For me, an internship was always a way to understand how things work practically. Coming from a less popular major viz. Pharmaceutical Engineering, it was even more difficult to understand what goes on in the lives of the professionals who are trained in the field as yours. This was my major motivation behind the internships I did in my first year.Yes and No. The exact answer would depend on what you expect to learn from the internship.If you wish to use the internship to yield a PPO (Pre-Placement Offer), learn about how the professional world revolves, how people work in teams in a constrained environment to deliver results/KPIs with deadlines it is surely worth it or enhance your personality, it’s surely worth it.However, if your ultimate goal is to get a job, especially in the Indian education system, then being able to pass the multiple selection/rejection tests and displaying that you’re the right fit for the job in the interviews trumps almost everything else.I value my experiences a lot. Internships taught me a lot of things and gave me deeper perspectives about how businesses function and how their various ends come together. I am fortunate enough to have been surrounded by some brilliant minds in college. All of them have worked hard to get to wherever they are and have different aspirations from the degree. For many, it’s landing that first dream job post graduation.However, for me, it’s not even the starting point, which would be somewhat close 3–4 years post graduation. And hence, these internships are the training bed and which, hopefully, would enable me to make the right choices in the journey.Clearly and precise communication has helped me. I have had clear expectations from the internships at various points in time and was honest about expressing my strengths/skills required for the role I was trying. Writing blogs about certain topics I like has helped me demonstrate my love/passion for the subject beyond my college curriculum and using that to network with individuals on various professional forums (LinkedIn, conferences, final stages of competitions) are some of the things I learned along the way, which by the way are immensely helpful.If you’re interning in some of the largest cities in the country — Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Chennai — it’s better if you tank the concept of weekends altogether especially if your college isn’t in any of these cities. These cities are the hotbeds of various hobby clubs and events throughout the year. Such events/meetups attract some of the best innovators/investors in the space and is a great chance to get noticed.During my stay at NCR in the last couple of summers, I spent Sundays in Starbucks’ located around popular spots in the city. The aim was to meet up consultants, bankers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs in a cold-call fashion — I didn’t know who’s who and yet I tried talking to each one of them by introducing myself to them. The chances of success are on the lower side but the long term benefits of it are hugely underestimated. Some of the best professional bonds I have developed recently are through such cold Starbucks’ meetups.Having a blog/few research publications/apps on the PlayStore largely help you get taken seriously by the community.Some of the areas I know a thing or two about being — Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Science/Analytics, Supply Chain, Product Management and Consulting in technical terms. In terms of understanding the business/broader management, I tend to drift towards Big Tech. I also understand how the businesses of FMCG and the Healthcare industries work (to some extent). And in general, I can also help you with some networking tips.Some general gyaanIt is increasingly becoming difficult for me to interact with people and while I still try and find time to do it (as it teaches me a lot), there are still a whole bunch of people who are left out. And I am sure there are several others who might approach me shortly. Hence, I felt a blog post would help me spread the message to a wider audience.I’m trying out a lot of different things I never felt I would. Since I am venturing into new areas, it’s increasingly becoming difficult for me to devote time to things like interacting with juniors. Don’t get me wrong — I still try and find time as and when I can but learning new things requires a lot of grit and perseverance.The picture above was a selfie capturing 3 of my school friends and myself. Starting from left —Rohit is a graduate of IIT B Computer Science Department and is going to pursue his Masters in Robotics at the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University. Ayush will be graduating with an Integrated Dual Degree in Manufacturing Engineering from IIT Kgp and already has Ph.D. offers from Canada and the UK. Biswa is a mechanical engineering graduate from NIT Durgapur and has headed to Purdue University for his Ph.D. And there were a few friends who are missing in this picture.Together, they form a strong group I have always been proud to be a part of. Spending time with them has helped me develop myself as an individual and whenever the chips are down, I talk to them seeking inspiration. There’s nothing I have done to deserve such a wonderful peer group growing up and am extremely grateful to have the privilege of having these talented individuals as a part of my childhood.I think life is short and I have always longed to be remembered after my death, in a positive sense of course. This simple thought has helped me train my mind to always think of the long term and never let small setbacks distract me. My vision, on the work front, is and always has been about doing things which outlive my stay.For example, during internships, the ambition is to contribute something so significant that people remember me even after I’ve completed my tenured stay. The same applies to most of the aspects of my life.Along the lines of the answer to the previous question, it’s very important to be in the right headspace. In college, your surroundings tend to distract you the most. Hence, it’s important to define a headspace which helps you build and retain focus.For example, I seldom tread aimlessly on the streets in college. I keep on talking to myself, albeit silently, twice a day — often scolding me for messing up things which I had planned to do. I try and walk fast as it keeps the mind active. I try and celebrate small successes like winning a competition or securing an internship with as little panache as I can — they’re important for developing friendships but shouldn’t make you complacent.These small things have helped me do things in a different way. For example, on 1st September ’19, I watched Aquaman on Amazon Prime somewhere between 2.5X — 3X. And between 31st August ’19 and 6th September ’19, I completed the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera watching most of the videos somewhere between 2X — 2.5X. I am now able to consume, process and retain this information in my brain and I credit this ability to the headspace.I will keep adding questions to this as and when I come across new ones and if I feel that question can help others as well. The objective of writing this now and maybe not after I have graduated is to make the sum total of my life’s experiences to others as I believe something can always be learned from the successes/failures of others.If you found this piece useful, hit the Applause, 👏, button — not because you would want to encourage me but to help make this post discoverable for others who can benefit from reading it.

Through core skills teaching, application development and teacher guidance, it is expected to fill the gaps in the blockchain education in Taiwan and to promote Taiwan’s energy and kinetic energy into a new generation of blockchain towns.Development of Blockchain has snowballed, and it is known as the next weapon for industrial upgrading and economic transformation. In recent years, the demand for talents in the global blockchain has soared, especially the shortage of talents in cross-disciplinary fields, which plays a key role in accelerating the application of blockchain. At present, most of the blockchain courses in Taiwan academics still focus on the introduction of basic concepts and lack of practical training. DEXON is committed to lowering the blockchain cognitive threshold, assisting in the integration of educational resources with industry, and integrating diverse talents to develop blockchain products and services that meet actual commercial needs.The three-month “Taiwan University of Science and Technology x is based on the bottom-line public chain DEXON-based blockchain practical class” for the Master of Science in Industrial Management Department of Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan University, and National Taiwan Normal University students. Professor Zhou Shuoyan and Prof. Yu Fengtian and The DEXON senior development team adopt small class interaction and full English teaching mode. Among them, DEXON will provide 12 practical operation courses covering the principles and programming language of a smart contract, DApps (Decentralized Applications) application status and prospects, DEXON development platform and tool teaching. Students are required to complete three proposals based on the DEXON platform, a personal presentation and a team presentation, and a professional comment by DEXON on technical feasibility and practicality.Huang Weining, co-founder and technical director of DEXON, said that Taiwan has scientific and technological talents who do not lose to Silicon Valley. Most of DEXON’s team members are elites from top universities and colleges in Taiwan. However, in the past decade or so, the Taiwanese industry has not taken the lead in grasping the explosive growth of the Internet and software sectors, so there is still a lack of global indicators of products and enterprises. As a new technology, the blockchain contains huge development potential and commercial value. DEXON believes that this is an excellent opportunity for Taiwan to once again shine on the international stage and win the right to speak in the industry.The popularity of blockchain is inseparable from the support of academics and the promotion of education. This in-depth cooperation with Taiwan University of Science and Technology is an important achievement of DEXON’s continuous deepening of campus and serial academic and corporate resources. DEXON also hopes to take this opportunity to attract more. More innovative talents are involved in the blockchain industry.The DEXON test network was opened to global developers in November 2018 and is located in Taiwan. It not only hosts DApps high-altitude hackathon in Taiwan, a series of blockchain development workshops, consensus algorithm paper guide classes, but also visit Taiwan University. Tsinghua University, Taiwan University of Science and Technology, political university and other campuses, exchange blockchain development prospects, and gradually expand blockchain technology and application possibilities.■ Source: digitimes■ Note: Please specify the source or references of the article for reproduced.■ Solemn declaration: We reproduced articles and news for purpose of sharing information.

345,23019,https://medium.com/@noelchristoper/the-digital-divide-d4ae59411897?source=tag_archive---------152-----------------------,The Digital Divide,None,"Noel ButarbutarFollow--1ListenShareI have studied the digital divide in socio-informatics and professionalism class a few weeks ago. Before looking at this topic I had no idea just how digitally divided we are in Indonesia. The digital divide is the discrepancy between people who have access to the internet to obtain resources, information and communication tools and people who do not have the resources and access to the technology. It also describes the difference between those who have the skills, knowledge and abilities to use the technologies and those who do not. The digital divide can exist between those living in rural areas and those living in urban areas, between the educated and uneducated, and also economic classes, and on a global scale between more and less industrially developed nations (Quinstreet, 2014).For example, we can put older adults who are beginning to use mobile internet to obtain information like using some kind of search engine and social media like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and many others. However, the quality of information obtained through mobile internet by older adults is hard to be guaranteed. That’s why the purpose of this article is to know the role of family support when older adults obtain information from mobile internet.For older adults, family support is the influencing factor of mobile internet literacy improvement. Family emotional support has stronger impacts on the improvement both of mobile internet skill literacy and of mobile internet information literacy than family cognitive support has. Furthermore, the improvement of both mobile internet skill literacy and mobile internet information literacy has positive impacts on the quality improvement of obtained information by older adults.This article gives advice on how family members can support older adults during their obtaining information from mobile internet to improve their mobile internet literacy and quality of obtained information. It examines the factors that influence mobile internet literacy and quality of obtained information among older adults from the perspective of family support of internet context.The point is as long as digital technology guided and used in the right way by anyone, there’s no problem using digital technology. Adults, kids, students, even elder is okay to using digital technology based on their individual needs.----1Noel Butarbutar--Noel Butarbutar--Noel Butarbutar--Noel Butarbutar--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Noel Butarbutar,https://medium.com/@noelchristoper,0,2,52

I’ll talk a little about my background, how I got to where I am and lots around key concepts.I’ll start out by saying, this is being written at my own pace, these will be written as and when I get time and the urge to write. I will also try and cover the area of why Platform Engineers are needed, as opposed to letting any technical staff member perform these tasks and why the good ones are a scarce resource. I might also talk a bit about the concept of a DevOps Engineer.The path to being a Platform Engineer varies noticeably. Different people bring a different set of skills.I started my career, early in 2008 as a Systems Administrator (with a BSc in IT Networks).I have supported and built Windows Systems but I quickly went down the Unix/Linux route, building and supporting systems on a variety of Operating Systems. Lots of this was self taught, I picked a rolling release Linux Distribution, used it at home, broke it and fixed it more than I care to remember. Until 4 years ago, my experience was with traditional Infrastructure in Data Centres.Enter Cloud Computing.By Cloud Computing, I specifically work only with AWS (for the moment anyway).Take all of the things that I was doing before and I now do these and more in the Cloud. During this time, I’ve worked as a Platform Engineer, a Cloud Architect and I’m currently a Platform Engineer again. I’m working for AND Digital, at Club Murray. Check us out https://and.digital/about/The reason I have briefly covered my background is that it is perfectly viable for a Platform Engineer to have a Developer Background or even a Windows based Systems Administrator background. I firmly believe that if Windows is the only knowledge area someone has, they will not get far as a Platform Engineer.Background covered, let’s start this series with a hypothetical scenario.As a quick note, when I talk about creating something, it’ll be done programatically, more on how and why later.Are you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin…Wonderful Corp are committing to an application going into AWS. This is their first venture into the cloud and are keen to follow best practices. The initial requirement includes multiple environments; Sandbox, Development, Pre-Prod & Prod.So, we need 1 AWS account with separate VPC’s for each environment, right? That would be the easiest way to do things. But not best practice. AWS recommends a multi-account environment as a security and compliance best practice.Here is how I would approach that, as a Platform Engineer.I would create an initial account for Wonderful Corp, for AWS Organizations to function. This is an AWS service in itself. AWS Organizations allows you to create multiple accounts within your Organization and group them together into organisational units for management. AWS Organizations features include:As Centralised Billing is going to happen here, I’ll refer to this account as Billing from now on.Incidentally, AWS Landing Zone is an alternative to AWS Organizations but don’t try and use both together, they’re not compatible.Before creating the accounts that are needed, how will they be accessed? Well, we just set up IAM users for each human to login at each account, right? Here’s what happens if that approach is taken; several years down the line Wonderful Corp has bought a couple of competitors and acquired more applications, this is gone from 5 accounts (including the Organizations one), to 13. Logging in, now requires 12 accounts to remember for each job role (because few people would have AWS Organizations top level access). Does this feel like the wrong approach yet? How about if those buyouts included a much bigger company and that number is now 120? Yeah, let’s not do that.Here is how I would approach that, as a Platform Engineer.I would take those original 5 accounts (including the Billing one) and add one for IAM accounts to exist. I strongly suggest that IAM users have email addresses as their username, this helps because:Whether this account is there purely for IAM users or has a wider scope is debatable. I’ve seen it used as a central Platform account aka Tools, aka DPM, aka Management. I’ve also seen accounts purely for IAM and another for the Management account. If it was my decision, I’d have Management as it’s own account, because that is always a production account. Never use that account as a test area.Next, we’ll create the account for IAM. Hmmm, that account that got created is just referred to by the 12 digit ID number, remembering that isn’t so easy. IAM nicely allows setting an alias for the account. I’d make it something like wcorp-access.Next would be creating IAM users for people to login. Again, we’re following best practice, we’ll have multiple IAM groups, one per job function, each user is a member of a group or more than one group. Attached to each group (not directly to each user, as that doesn’t scale well), there would be a policy. This is referred to as an assume-role policy that allows assumption of a role. This can be used for roles in other accounts or the same account, using the same process just makes sense. In this case, the assume-role policy allows assumption of a role in one or more of the other accounts. Each IAM user will need to have Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) enabled before being able to switch role. The AWS console keeps the 5 most recent roles a user has switched to, allowing a single click to assume a role, anyone wanting to use more, I encourage the use of https://github.com/1Strategy/blog-aws-extend-switch-roles .Next, would be creating the other accounts, along with a set of common roles to be assumed, such as Admin, Dev, Tester. These roles would have their own policy attached to them. Each of these policies would set the actions that the human assuming this role would be allowed to do. For example, the Admin role my have the AWS-Adminstrator policy attached to it. I find the AWS policies are by default too permissive. Custom policies would be my preference.Here’s what the end result was:Awesome Sauce.----Adam King--Adam King--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Prajwal T--3Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Love SharmainDev Genius--10HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Adam King,https://medium.com/@arking_32379,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OuRPNKuAgKXQ3QdqmQg1AA.jpeg",5,1

I received great feedback from the online community including a request to track Phantom Drain in regards to Sentry Mode.One would think Sentry Mode would add significant loss of State of Charge (SoC) as the cameras, front and side repeaters, would have to be constantly on and recording a buffer to the USB stick in the car, however there is only one way to know, raw data and numbers.Previous Posts from August 2018 and April 2019.Testing Methodology RecapQuick recap for those jumping into this post without reading the others, my methodology of data collection is very simple. I have signed up with my energy provider to track my charging habits and in return I get small monetary reward plus access to my car’s trip data logged by the C2 FleetCarma Device, shown below. I then take the data, calculate changes in SoC and report my findings.ResultsFrom my previous tests I have concluded that Cabin Overheat protection adds minimal impact to the SoC versus my perceived benefit of protecting the interior. In order to have a baseline I took the average of data collected since installing the device in late January and currently average 2.73% loss per day on a 2018 LR Model 3.With 2.73% as the baseline I activated Sentry Mode for six days with the results in the image below. May 1st can be considered an outlier as the car was off the charger for 13 hours and parked in a lot at the local performing arts center triggering Sentry multiple times.Throwing out May 1st the average SoC loss is 4.10% which was a difference of 1.37% against the baseline. Averaging all 6 days SoC loss was 4.49% or 1.76% difference.One thing to note is the number of events appears to have little impact on SoC loss and this is most likely because the cameras appear to be constantly recording and overwriting a buffer on the USB stick only fully committing the video when an “event” has been triggered.How much does this cost?Extrapolating this further I wanted to calculate the dollar cost of activating Sentry mode, first to do so I have to cover some assumptions:Battery pack size: 75kWhEffectiveness from Wall to Car: 80%*Cost of Electricity: $0.1159 per kWhDifference in SoC: 1.37% — 1.76%Calculation is simple at Battery Size * Percent Drain / Effectiveness * Cost of Electricity.This mean sentry mode is $0.15-$0.19 extra to run per day or rounding to the nearest whole dollar, $6/month when activated every day.*I feel 80% is a conservative assumption and effectiveness in practice is more than likely much higher.Conclusion$6/month for video surveillance around my car is a cheap insurance policy. We have already seen a number of viral videos posted online where the perpetrators of hit and runs were found after the fact. Each person will have their own perceived value and if you live in a location where electricity has a higher cost it may not be worth the extra security feature.I am however hoping there will be a few updates to Sentry Mode. First would be a way to manage and view the recordings in the car. There are USB sticks that can be purchased that plugin directly to a mobile device (phone or tablet) but that still requires removing the stick form the car. In addition Sentry event recordings are not overwritten, for good reasons, but if you have a smaller stick this will cause it to possibly fill up in a few days. Second, which we know is coming, is the ability to change settings of record always, record in specific location, etc.Overall though I am pleased with the new feature and I do hope the above improvements, plus more, are implemented in future software updates. I still tell everyone that Teslas are vehicles that improve overtime. Other manufacturers sometime provide software updates, though typically for a fee, but Teslas update with new features so regularly it is like you get a new car every month.----1Paul Einselen--Paul Einselen--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Paul Einselen,https://medium.com/@pdeinselen_5410,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jna-WhuZB31_R59Fdc3IQw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jORINS9rgntRjvy15Dp91Q.png",4,12

350,36845,https://medium.com/@studio_79615/7-hot-trends-in-ar-8382ef39aa48?source=tag_archive---------117-----------------------,7 Hot Trends in AR,None,"Happy FinishFollow--ListenShareWhat’s hot in the world of AR right now? Happy Finish CTO Marco Marchesi shared his views with publication CIO earlier this month. Here’s what he believes are the key trends currently shaking up the world of augmented reality.Part of my job is testing and implementing emerging technologies, and my ‘mission’ is to make magically possible what was previously considered just a crazy creative idea.But in order to do so, some design/build/fail/success steps are required across a continuous R&D attitude. Here, I want to identify seven trends that I have personally experienced and seen rising in the AR market in the last 6–8 months (most could actually be applied to VR or MR as well). I will also highlight what kind of benefits and challenges we may expect from them.1.Context AwarenessWe are seeing more and more AR apps and tools that are context-aware. Deep learning processes are the most commonly used techniques to gain an insight into what the frame captured by the camera contains. So — object detection, segmentation or image-to-image translation (my personal favourite: recognise the reality and transform it) are commonly the most used models. If AR is able to keep tabs of what is around us by tracking the visual features that appear on camera, Deep Learning techniques guess what is in the scene. From a simple description of the objects in front of us to a more sophisticated interaction between a virtual avatar and your laptop display, the opportunities are infinite. Check out our semantic AR experiment to see this in action.2. Location AwarenessWhen Niantic released Pokemon Go, it was clear that location-based AR apps had to be ‘a thing’ at some point. But placing gyms and items to collect was just the first step. In the meantime, other companies were working under the rear to map the real world and build a virtual one on top of it. Recently, a London-based startup called Scape released its SDK that allows users to place AR assets that persistently stay anchored on the buildings located in areas scanned in one hundred cities around the world. Snapchat introduced ‘Landmarkers’, so the users are able to see famous monuments — from Tour Eiffel to Buckingham Palace — augmented in the most creative ways.3. Remote RenderingThe idea of relying on remote rendering capabilities to give superpowers to AR mobile content is not new, but over the years it has faced the constraints of poor network bandwidth, limited hardware and significant latency. With the advent of 5G and edge computing, the concept is coming to reality and the first demos of real-time rendering performed on a server machine and visualised remotely on a mobile device have been published. The first example of this has been Microsoft, who introduced remote rendering as one of its Azure ecosystem options — but I expect many more cloud rendering services to come very soon, along with cloud software or platforms (e.g. Stadia).4. Faster networksStrictly related to the previous point, Edge Computing will make it possible to achieve challenging ideas where speed and reliability are not an option. Let’s imagine how difficult it may be to deliver remote rendering in a stadium to 10,000 users during a sports event or a concert. Besides this, 5G aims to be the natural partner of Edge Computing in delivering fast, richer and reliable experiences. Its adoption rate will be key in defining how much server-based solutions will be successful, compared to existing locally managed technologies. For example, currently, body tracking can be performed on a mobile phone by running a light AI model locally. As the mobile computational power increases and some companies like Apple or Huawei have introduced their own dedicated AI chips on phone, Deep Learning architectures become deeper and more computationally expensive; requiring more battery, memory and processing resources. 5G will make it possible to run such architectures remotely in real-time, without any noticeable latency.5. Virtual try-onAdvances in Deep Learning have allowed us to achieve more accurate body-tracking results that can run in real-time on mobile devices. The retail industry, particularly sports and fashion, will take advantage of the opportunity for users to try on clothes and accessories on their mobile phones or AR mirrors in-store — making shopping a question of ‘try before you buy’, with customisation and visual effects dominating the experience. On top of that, with virtual try-on apps, we can expect a reduction of returns (why would I order something if I don’t like how it fits virtually?) and consequently of CO2 emissions caused by transportation.6. LensFor a while, AR lenses and filter effects seemed just a playful alternative to more sophisticated SLAM-based AR frameworks that were running natively on mobile. Furthermore, content creation suffered by the limitations of the filter platforms in terms of file size and number of vertices. With faster networks, we will see higher-quality assets and new functionalities will be introduced, along with face tracking, body tracking (of pets too!) and gesture recognition.7. WebOne of the questions that I answer often is ‘When Web AR?’ For years we have seen implementations of marker-based solutions written in Javascript and WebGL (particularly with ThreeJS) that were compromised by the fragmentation of web browsers scenario (it runs on Chrome/Firefox but not on Safari, or vice-versa), as well as bandwidth. The introduction of WebAssembly and AR-ready browsers has made possible the publication of marker-less experiences with a few, or even zero, lines of code (see AR Quick Look on Safari). Now the world is ready to be seen in AR, without downloading any apps.----Global creative production studio based in London, Portland and Mumbai.

Technology is slowly being introduced into every aspect of our lives and we use it more than we think on a daily basis. On the horizon for 2020 is virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR), which will be integrated in to all aspects of businesses. Just a few years ago people thought that these type of realities only existed in films and never knew they had such a wide application not only in business but retail, medicine, emergency services just to name a few. The end goal is to reinvent entertainment and education with VR, AR and MR while applying these practices to business practices to enhance the overall experience. People often get confused between VR, AR and MR. In this weeks blog we break down each reality and explain the differences between them. Out of all three realities, VR is the most widely known and used.Virtual Reality (VR) VR can be described as a simulated experience that can be similar to the real world or completely fictional. VR is used for entertainment purposes and is designed to give its users an experience out of the ordinary. Currently VR systems use virtual reality headsets to generate the simulation of a users physical presence in a virtual environment. When the headset is on, the user is able to move around, hear sounds and interact with the virtual features in that reality. VR is most commonly used in the entertainment sector with video games and 3D cinemas. In saying that, it doesn’t mean it couldn’t have other uses and applications.Augmented Reality (AR) AR can be described as an interactive experience of a real world environment. The contents in the reality are enhanced and as close to real objects as possible. AR uses sounds, video, graphics and other sensory based inputs to bring a real experience to the user. So, by adding AR features to technology devices, it enables content to be digitally manipulated. The most famous example of AR is the game Pokemon Go, the game became increasingly popular just after it was released in 2016. In the game players locate Pokemon characters that pop up in the real world, on your side walk, garage, office or gym. Game’s aside there are many other uses for AR in a users everyday life.Mixed Reality (MR) MR can be described as merging real world and fictional world experiences to bring the user completely new environments. Where physical and digital inputs exist at the same time, in real time. MR is a combination of VR and AR, MR overlays virtual objects to real world objects. Which in return allows users to connect with both virtual and real world objects. By combining both realities together it enables new environments and visualisations become possible to co-exist and interact.So whats the difference between the three realities? VR provides a completely immersed experience that shuts out the real world. AR adds virtual elements to the real world through a users camera on their smartphone. MR combines elements of both VR and AR with both real world and virtual elements that interact with the user. While all three realities continue to offer unexplored opportunities, it is nothing new that they have potential among different sectors across the globe. This has been creating excitement in the world of digital marketing, these realities have been seen as a new e-commerce platform in the retail world, which will challenge current brick and mortar stores. As mobile connectivity continues to improve as well as newer and more efficient ways of working, VR, AR and MR could lead to new ways of doing things in business.----Matrex’s blockchain solution helps food brands validate and easily share information with consumers about their products’ origin, social impact and wellbeingMatrex® Blockchain--Matrex® Blockchain--Matrex® Blockchain--Matrex® Blockchain--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Christina SainUX Planet--64Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Matrex® Blockchain,https://medium.com/@matrex_blockchain,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ByrS35keSIJvQB84IrTprw.png",3,0
352,13769,https://medium.com/@danieldavidwriter/gateway-6ea054ca5ee5?source=tag_archive---------98-----------------------,Gateway,None,"Daniel DavidFollow--ListenShareNisha Drake stood on her balcony overlooking the city and took several deep breaths of air. It had been a long night and she really needed to straighten her head. There was always a good breeze up here, cool and clean, so she turned her face into it and flopped her head backwards to stare up into the brightening sky. She would leave today, she knew it.The feeling had been growing inside her all week, unplanned and unexpected really, but she knew that today was the day she would go. A smile crossed her face, followed by a little laugh in her nose and a shrug of her shoulders that looked like a quiet sneeze, but was in fact a delicious burst of joy, relief, love and contentment. She spun on her heels and headed back inside, immediately kneeling down at the coffee table to scratch out another line as thick as a boot lace.Nisha lent forwards over the drug smeared and cup strewn plastic table with a short black straw to snarl it up her nose. It stung as it clawed it’s way towards her brain in brambly clots, whilst the familiar acrid slime slid and gagged down the back of her throat, making her reach out to gulp down more warm champagne. Not the best gear in the world, more MDMA and aspirin than coke, but she liked the trashy, trippy hit it was giving and at this time in the morning anything would do. The sound of birds singing from the shadows drifted in through the balcony door, counterpointing her shame with their delicate trills and chirrups, as the first light of the day added a faint wash of colour to the greyscale streets outside.As she massaged her nostrils to hurry the drug along on it’s journey into her blood, she felt her body prickle with anticipation and her spine judder and spasm a little deep inside the flesh of her neck. She glanced up at the guy chewing his lip expectantly opposite her. The magic was melting off him as the dawn light took hold, but she’d hoped he would stick around and here he was, looking jaded and day old like a party sandwich that was still essentially the same, but giving off clues that it should’ve been enjoyed 12 hours ago.He was young and keen though. Full of the bravado every twenty-something first job guy had, and he had great tits. Great sirloin steak tits and broad, action-figure arms. Arms that she’d fantasised about more than once since she’d hired him and that undoubtedly made him more memorable than he should be. She obsessed endlessly over the pale and solid curve that burst out from his cotton sleeve, that fattened and stretched the fabric each time he picked up his drink or self-consciously cupped his chest. Her fingers could sense the tautness of his skin, daydream the weight of him as her hands cupped his chest and pushed up against him.He’d worked for Nisha for two weeks already, but she still couldn’t remember his name. Nick? Ned? Nevin? It began with an N, she was sure of that, and it was his first job since graduating. A decent job as well. She was paying him way over the odds just for the sake of it. He probably had serious money in his account for the first time ever, a job that you almost couldn’t fuck up, and the effortless under-thirties looks that you don’t know you have until they’re gone. Not that that would ever happen to him, of course.She carved out another line and gestured the straw towards him. She’d been here before, tediously role playing the crazy night crawler to build a temporary sense of camaraderie with some guy who most likely cared about her as little as she did. For the briefest moment she would feel less alone, before the daylight came back and a brutal despair rampaged into her mind with the vicious deprecation only a hard-earned comedown can generate.He leant forwards to snort the gear and she took the moment to play with a curl of hair that fell from his fringe and danced like a seahorse in front of her. From there, she ran her hand across his cheekbone and down his neckline, over the broad, bulging muscle in his shoulder and down the vein in his arm, before jumping left to brush under the heavy curve of his chest. The music had stopped, although she hadn’t noticed at the time, and she heard his breath quicken a little and his nylon t-shirt crackle under her fingers.I feel like fucking — she said.Since the Gates of Heaven had opened, every night went by like this.Nobody that was still here really cared anymore. Nobody had anything to lose, so the ritual of determined debauchery and oblivion had become the afterwork activity of choice, whilst afterwork was getting earlier and earlier every day. For Nisha, sometimes just sending an email over breakfast meant the after work fun could begin all over again.Of the people who remained, some were squeezing the last few drops from their physicality before going upstairs, others were exploring ever darker corners of their imagination, whilst some — like Nisha — were exploiting the situation and making huge amounts of money. She didn’t need it anymore of course, she could leave whenever she wanted to, but this was the first time in her life that she’d had an idea that actually made money. Real money. More money than she’d ever imagined. After years of mediocre businesses that seemed cool enough, but in reality just about scraped along — working 70 hour weeks but earning half as much as her friends; travelling on business trips but only ever economy; pitching at investment events that felt like begging but with slides and artisan coffee — this business was next level. She only had to do about one hours work a day, and even that was really just checking that the server was switched on. After that, the money kept rolling in.Nisha had created an app called Gateway. Gateway monitored local weather stations for the changes in air pressure that always preceded the Gates opening. The geolocation in your phone would tell you if you could get there in time, and through a few links to transport services it would even tell you the best route to take. Simple really, but she’d made twenty million in the first two weeks, and every single day since then her bank account had filled back up as fast as she could empty it.She’d never felt the energy of a good idea working well before. A winner! An indisputable, surefire, class A hit. Gateway was the sort of thing that people wrote about in Forbes magazine, or shared motivational stories about on LinkedIn. In any other time she would’ve had investors crawling all over her, offering crazy sums for a piece of the action. She’d have been featured in one of those nauseating ‘top females under thirty’ lists, giving talks on women in tech and proclaiming how ‘anyone can do it if they believe in themselves’. But not in this time.This time no one cared about her future plans or market share, her growth curve or exit strategy. They all used Gateway just once, to get out and never look back. The irony rubbed, but she forced it out of her mind, focused on the here and now and each night drank, snorted and fucked the tragedy of her hopeless success out of her mind.Besides, she had told herself she wouldn’t leave until she was ready. Things were getting more fucked up the longer she stayed, and she had kind of like it. It was messy, exciting and very cinematic.Nick or Ned or whoever it was, looked up at her as he inhaled his line and tried to look shocked by Nisha’s bluntness, but as he straightened back up his face confessed that he gave as little of a shit as she did, and he smiled a wasted and disinterested smile as he brushed a few crumbs from the stubble on his top lip.Sure, why not — his voice croaked as the coke brought him to the edge of a sneeze.He squeezed his nostrils and held his breath before moving up to kiss her, the stale smell of champagne advancing towards her in hot blows. His lips felt surprisingly soft and warm and in the brief moment that she was lost in their tenderness, Nisha felt a lump appear unexpectedly in her throat as a great wave of sorrow and loss, swelled and broke in her chest. Was she going to cry? In a panic, she flipped it. Flipped it to anger and pushed him backwards with her mouth, rising up from her knees and biting on his lip until he recoiled, sliding awkwardly off his chair. His body twisted underneath her onto the floor and his legs buckled up behind him like a corpse.She stopped for a moment and raised herself up to look at him, her back arched and her arms locked solid.Want some viagra?No — he sounded shy all of a sudden, so young — I’m ok, thank you.In heaven, Marlon was watching. He watched her often because he still loved her despite everything. He loved her even though he had to keep reminding himself that this person, this stranger who drank and snorted and fucked away every day and all of their memories, was not the same Nisha that he knew. This was another Nisha, born out of this extremely fucked up situation. She was confused, surely. Frightened, maybe. Lost? Stressed? Traumatised? Maybe a little bit of all of these things, but it didn’t matter. He knew who she really was, and that she could still be saved.***For Marlon, everything was wrong. Every day and every moment.This wasn’t how it was meant to be. They’d walked to the Gates together hand in hand. They’d thrown a party the night before, to celebrate going up. She’d told him that she was giving Gateway away, making it open source so anybody could use it. She’d told him that they would be in heaven together, with no more work and no more stress. No more problems and no more stupid mistakes. But it was all a lie.He often day-dreamed back to their leaving party, when their remaining friends had piled into their new apartment and drunk shots and jumped around wildly to Rage Against the Machine and Sum41. Lampshades were broken and drinks were spilled on their beautiful carpet, but this new life of theirs was so fresh and unmade that there was precious little else to break. No pictures, no furniture, no best glasses, no sentimental objects. Somebody broke the arm on the Technics turntable, but since they weren’t using it nobody cared. It was still revolving silently the next morning when they left.Most of their guests that night were much like their expensive new apartment. Picked up in the last few weeks they were still strange and unknown, a little empty perhaps, gorgeous but generic, and only theirs as a result of the money they now had. The money that came in so fast they didn’t know what to do with it all, apart from rent expensive flats, cheap friends and meaningless good times. Marlon could see the fakery now, he sort of knew it then, but it had still felt amazing.They were a strange bunch, those still here.The most moral and virtuous people had gone within the first week of the Gates opening, racing eagerly to get to the afterlife that their childhood had promised them. Whether raised on old testament brutality or glossy Sunday school pamphlets, whether they wore a cross or a hijab, carried a knife or rosary beads, now was their moment of truth and excited validation and there was no reason to delay.Your average person went up a few weeks later, reassured by endless 24 hour news items and social media discussions that the Gates weren’t an alien trap or some kind of government conspiracy, and deciding that the chaos that was rapidly taking over the non-celestial world was now by far the worst option. A quick re-read of the bible, a few Wikipedia searches in case there was a quiz and they were gone. Delivered from evil, for ever and ever.Others stayed back to do some good amongst the orphans and lost souls of the growing bloodshed, the refugees caught in the rising tide of revenge attacks and lustful tourism, but eventually even they left, electing to save themselves and leave the rest of the population to whatever personal fate they had chosen.Those left behind now were fanatical non-believers, the guilty and guilt ridden, hoarders and mercenaries, those who cowered in the face of change and those for whom pain and pleasure and death were far more attractive than infinite paradise. How strange it was, that with the promise of unqualified salvation, the cruelty and deviance within even the gentlest soul had been awakened in a counter-reaction, that quickly spilled beyond even the most extreme moral boundaries.Marlon could still feel the butterflies that danced in his belly for that whole night and into the morning when they left. On that day, the morning was fresh and clear. The crisp night air lingered in the shade, whilst the rising sun beat down on their bare skin as they began their purposeful but apprehensive walk to the Gates.They were both in T-shirt’s and shorts, hand in hand, enjoying what might be their last touch. Perhaps this was the last warm breeze to ruffle through the soft hairs on their arms, or the last rays of sunlight to warm their heads and shoulders.Nisha had her phone out with Gateway open, calling out directions every once in a while as the app wound them through alleyways and parks. They passed a supermarket with every one of it’s windows broken. Apples and wine bottles lay amongst the broken glass, a burnt out SUV with a ‘Jesus loves you’ sticker sent thin trails of black smoke into the calm air as it smouldered, and bodies lay crumpled on the ground in the shadow of a tower block — an increasingly common sight. A couple holding hands over here, a child lying alone over there.At one point they startled a dog that was scratching through rubbish, piled ten feet high against a wall in a school playground. It looked up with a start, blood dripping from the tin-can cuts on it’s jowls, before skittling off with it’s tail between it’s legs when Marlon stamped his feet.Crossing a deserted junction, the faraway bass of the Neverending Rave, a 24 hour party that had been running non-stop since the first few appearances of the Gates, thudded gently to a lost melody before being cut off again the moment they turned the next corner.Eventually, the familiar halo in the sky came in to view, first behind the skyline a few streets away and then rising high overhead. Nisha put her phone away and they both gazed up at the wonder that swirled overhead.It was an awe inspiring sight. Gentle waves of colour danced about in the air and across every surface like mother of pearl, whilst a warm and constant breeze spun around and around in a huge circle of leaves and dust directly under the Gates. There was hardly any sound, a few hushed voices from the handful of other people standing around, but nothing more.The strange calm reminded Marlon of his one and only sailing adventure. As a boy he and his father had set sail for France together, but in the dead off night the wind had failed and they spent hours bobbing vulnerable and hopeless in the dark. Hanging over the stern with his head resting on his arm and his finger tips trailing in the water, the cold black sea had slowly warmed into peach and rose ripples and eddies as the day brightened and the wind finally returned to them.In the centre of the Gates, a bright white beam shone down like a search light and every now and then the softened silhouette of a new leaver raced up and away into the sky.Marlon and Nisha walked in together, hearts pounding and their fingers digging tightly into each others palms. Marlon led the way and as he entered the light, he felt a roar of energy and incredible weightlessness that lifted his feet gently from the ground. He began to laugh and turned around to smile at Nisha next to him, but she wasn’t there. Her hand was stretched out as far as it would go whilst her feet remained firmly planted on grey pavement. He could barely see her face through the blinding light and had to twist his neck as far as it would go to keep her in view, as it slowly but inescapably turned him upside down. His hand gripped hers tightly now and his feet flapped wildly in the air. He held onto her as hard as he could, but he could feel her fingers wriggling and he was so stressed that his palms were sweating and he could feel her sliding out from his grip.What’s wrong? — he yelled at her through the roaring.Nisha! What’s wrong?He couldn’t see her now. His eyes were streaming from the intensity of light and his inverted state made focussing almost impossible.Sorry! — he heard her shout out through the wind, just once, before her hand finally slipped out from his and he flew up and away from her, tumbling like street litter in a storm.And so, that was how this came to be. Another day of longing and anger and sadness, in this place that was meant to give the opposite of all those things.Marlon felt uneasy about this contradiction. Had he done something wrong? There had been no pep talk when he arrived, no one to greet him or induct him into this new world. Had he missed it somehow? He’d gone back to where he arrived to check, but there didn’t seem to be anything special about the place. No door or desk, no greeters or receptionists or whatever you might expect to find on the other side of the Gates. It was much like every other place up here, a meadow on a warm day with a few people hanging around.He felt guilty, disappointed even, that he seemed to have messed this up somehow. He spent his days with as good an impression of bliss on his face as he could conjure, whilst constantly thinking about Nisha, When he was sure he was alone, he would relax his face and guiltily watch her through the clouds, yawning his mouth to relieve the cramp of endless smirking.He had no idea how he was meant to behave or feel. He slept on the ground, as that’s what everyone else seemed to do. He ate fruit from the trees and drank water from the pools that seemed to be everywhere. Too many, he had thought. All around him people strolled peacefully about or lay around in a state of bliss. They exchanged smiles but never spoke, they embraced but never kissed. They ate and drank and slept and he wondered enviously how they knew what they were supposed to be doing.Every now and then he would hear the unmistakable sound of an angel flying overhead and hurriedly begin admiring a branch, or dreamily wafting his fingers in a nearby pool of water. He hadn’t met an angel yet, but their dark silhouettes soared overhead regularly, casting long shadows which cooled the ground and flattened the ripples on the water. Once, one had hovered overhead, it’s wing feathers twitching rapidly as it hung in the air almost motionless, before diving down with terrifying speed on the other side of an orchard. Marlon couldn’t see what happened, but he heard the most terrible shrieks and decided that it might be better if he never met one.Nisha was sleeping now. He liked to watch her as she slept. He ignored the fact that she was partially clothed, that she was surrounded by empty bottles and detritus, that her phone had rung about a dozen times and she still hadn’t heard it. Instead he watched her face. It made small twitches and ticks as she slept, sometimes with the hint of a smile. Sometimes her lips moved almost imperceptibly as if she was whispering a secret. She had always done this and it told Marlon that, no matter what was happening now, the old Nisha was still there and she would come to him eventually.A noise behind him made him start from his daydream and turn around abruptly. It was so instinctive that for a moment he forgot entirely where he was, or to imprint the bliss back onto his face.There was a girl standing just a few feet from him. A young girl, maybe late teens or early twenties, in a blue pinafore dress with a buttercup hem that fluttered about her knees in the breeze. She had mud on her shoes and her hands picked at each other nervously.He had no idea how long she’d been there. She stared expressionless directly at him, not in bliss, not in horror, just staring into his eyes, frozen in the moment. A moment which seemed to stretch on forever and made Marlon blink inexplicably several times. He kept expecting her to speak, but she never did and several moments passed when he wished he’d thought of the right thing to say and said it already.As he decided that he simply must say something, anything, he noticed a tear had appeared like a pearl in her eye. It dropped out and ran fast down her cheek, etching a pale streak in her blushed skin. It was swiftly followed by another, and another, and before long her face and neck were wet with tears as they stared at each other in silence. Marlon felt sick as an understanding grew from nothing into everything inside of him, and the truth exploded out of both of them and crawled it’s way across the wilting grass and putrifying water.***Nisha woke to the sound of her phone buzzing on the coffee table next to her. Her eyelids peeled apart and the sunlight burst in to sting the surface of her eyes and cause a sharp pain in the nerves that tied them to her head. She was sweating. As she sat up her head pounded even more and she cradled it in her hands to soothe the pain and resist the sudden urge to throw up.She swiped her phone awake and saw she had dozens of missed calls, all from Nick. She called him back.Hey — she said, her voice still asleep.Why are you calling, aren’t you here?No, I left hours ago — he said — Have you just woken up?No — she lied — why, what’s up?Have you not seen Gateway? — he sounded freaked out.Why, what’s up? — she said again, holding the phone at arms length and refocusing her eyes.She swiped up and clicked on the Gateway icon as she searched around for a nearby glass of water. She found champagne.When Gateway opened the map was going crazy. Little blue markers were all over the screen, so many that the route finder clearly wasn’t sure what to do and was conspicuously empty.Wow — she said more quietly than she expected — We’ll have to fix that route finder bug later. How many are there?Too many to count, — said Nick — but that’s not it.Oh?There was a pause.They go down Nisha. Down.Another pause.What do we do?----A writer based in the UK. ‘Migration’ now available on Amazon in paperback or KindleDaniel David--Daniel David--Daniel David--Daniel David--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Christina SainUX Planet--64Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Daniel David,https://medium.com/@danieldavidwriter,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zm8AbF_fzyy45E76d--vkw.jpeg",16,50

Just think about it- when was the last time you used your laptop or computer to run a quick google search or even perform any other simple activity that required the internet?The answer to this usually is a long time ago, so now that mobiles have become our window to the internet it was almost essential for it to be evolved accordingly. While most of the mobile-internet interaction occurs via the usage of mobile applications, in this age of diverse dynamism it is simply impossible to store an app for every activity you want to do. The amount of storage space you’d need for that would just be a preposterous number! Hence comes access to websites on mobile phones and hence comes the PWAs.PWAs or Progressive Web Application is a kind of software development methodology, they can be understood as a hybrid model of traditional web pages and mobile application. In simpler terms, you may just say that PWA is the combination of the advantages and best features of mobile apps and web pages. It is this, that enables the browser to have a more mobile-friendly, a more comprehensive and more immersive experience.By now I think you may have come to realize the importance of PWA in our mobile-internet interaction. There is however much more that it brings to the table. As an example, think you have admitted one of the web pages opened in the browser to the home screen (the option is provided on the pages). Now every time you would open the home screen, you shall have a little badge of this web page, which upon clicking shall enable you to skip the tedious process of typing and take you directly to the desired web page. It is not just that, it starts providing you notifications and at times even hides the UI and the page actually does start functioning as an app. The web pages are easier to access, faster to load and even have an offline presence. And with the onset of features like providing notifications and updates to the users, they have induced a much sought-after experience in the browser-user interaction. The best part is that it is not limited to mobile phones, it is also a feature just as actively present and exploited in your computers, bringing the two devices closer than they wee ever before.With an analysis of PWAs in progression, it is of absolute importance that we discuss the Service Worker. It is if loosely defined, a script run by the browser in the background, and it is that which enables PWAs to load almost immediately without any concern for the state of the internet connection or speed. They add the feature of reliability to the PWAs as they enable intelligent caching, push notifications and other background functions.The speed factor provided as a result of this entire charade should not be overlooked either. As numerous studies have suggested and you may yourself observe that as much as 53% of the users leave a website if takes more than 3 seconds to load. Thus, for companies developing such internet services, use of PWAs may as well be one of the biggest arrows in the quiver with it ensuring high-speed loading of web pages even on the diciest network conditions.Another way to assess the importance of this incredible feature is the results it has yielded since its onset in the recent past. Google Chrome seems to have grown to 1 Billion users from a mere 400 Million in 2016. This monstrous growth and that too the short time of just two years is indicative of how the integration of the PWA with the browser has moved the users. It is in fact being suggested by the most notable experts in this field that the earlier trend to abandon a website and open an app (as done by companies like Flipkart) has in reality backfired. The rationalization is pretty simple, that with PWAs already bringing in the ‘best of the applications’ going through the trouble to download an app and follow the entire arduous process and then at the end compromise the limited data storage space that we have on our devices seems not to be worth the trouble.With such grand tales of the accomplishments of the PWA it is important that at the end some flaws are pointed out as well. A major shortcoming would be that while many browsers like google and Samsung support this format, there still exist quite a few that don’t. Further, the competition between the mobile apps and web pages is still going strong and will take some more time to resolve, thus the inclusion of companies and users in this arena though on the rise, is yet to reach its true potential. Further, many of the added advanced features that are otherwise present in apps and devices like the fingerprint scanner are yet to make a notable presence in the PWAs.Thus, its integration in every device still remains a question that can only be answered in time. Recent trends certainly give an optimistic result but at the same time, there is a need for PWAs to evolve constantly and immerse the latest of advancement that has become common in most devices and be even more handy to its dynamic set of users.----A next-gen digital transformation company that helps enterprises transform business through disruptive strategies & agile deployment of innovative solutions.Successive DigitalinSuccessive Digital--3Successive DigitalinSuccessive Digital--3Successive DigitalinSuccessive Digital--4Successive Digital--pandaquestsinLevel Up Coding--Melih YumakinJavaScript in Plain English--12Christina SainUX Planet--64Dhananjay GarginUX Planet--3Pitis Radu--2Melih Yumak--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Successive Digital,https://medium.com/@successive_digital,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*scetGmlnIhjvqsPLAAgePQ.jpeg",4,0

Readers should refer to the Quras technical whitepaper for details on the mechanics of implementation.Transparent addresses work similarly to what is implemented on Bitcoin. The private key is generated randomly first out of the key pair, and the public key is then derived using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). QURAS uses a secp256r1 standard for its public key generation, which is enforced by organizations such as the NSA. Although Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 standard for its key pair generation, QURAS uses an alternative as an extra measure of security.Users can choose between two industry-leading private transaction methods, zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) and ring signatures. The former is considered as a more robust method of privacy; however, will consume more system resources to produce the result. Thus, the second option of Ring Confidential Transactions is offered to give users an option of fast and light anonymous transactions. To accommodate for these transaction types, users can generate the appropriate keys to construct the transactions — spend, receiving, viewing, anonymous and stealth keys.The QURAS blockchain includes a virtual machine layer, which users can use to deploy smart contracts written in C#, a widely adopted programming language.7 Developers can utilize two key functions within their contract code — zero-knowledge proof and validation methods. These functions are general purpose and can be implemented in the contract code for a wide variety of use cases.As these privacy methods are merely functions, developers freely choose to use them in order to create transparent or secret contracts. Whenever a user calls (interacts) with a smart contract, QURAS GAS is consumed.There are two types of anonymous transactions — complete anonymity and partial anonymity.Completely Anonymous Transaction means all transaction information will be hidden including sender’s address, recipient’s address, remitted amount, etc.A Partly Anonymous Transaction means a part of transaction information such as the sender’s address, recipient address or remittance amount is hidden.A Part Anonymous Transaction uses zk-SNARKs or the ring signature technology to realize the anonymous effect. For more details, please refer to the technical paper.----Secret Contract Platform for Privacy 2.0qurasofficial--qurasofficial--qurasofficial--qurasofficial--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",qurasofficial,https://medium.com/,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Mi2bi7h-jPLPOXmX38Oc2g.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*CXZxNcDsCOfoY4uhKTvEww.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*wc3aqAUkIiU2dmL0JH0Qdw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zzdFPiZ659DY2hlZAYyKZA.png",3,2

Teachers Ben Mosteller, Kristin Kowalew, and Allison Ewing wanted students to showcase their understanding of the unit by creating an Agricultural Awareness PSA. One of the tools we have been using often at Bullis this school year to help students creatively demonstrate and synthesize their knowledge is WeVideo, an online video editor that allows students to collaboratively work on projects from any device. A major benefit we have seen in using WeVideo for projects this year is that it gives some of our quieter students a chance to make their voice shine. Helping students build confidence in presenting has been a big focus of ours, and embracing tech tools like WeVideo has helped us achieve this goal.“I was proud of the quieter students who stepped up and participated in the voiceover element of the project. We had them work in pairs but didn’t mandate that both students talked — although almost all of them did.” ~Ben MostellerStudents had been studying the rise of agriculture (including the various agricultural revolutions), many different forms of agriculture, and the overall impacts of rural land use. Students had already utilized a variety of media and case studies, including video and textual resources, to analyze the impacts of agriculture on the environment and globalization, and vice versa. Students had been working to:For this mini-project, students researched an agricultural issue in the DMV and were asked to make the public aware of it using WeVideo. Their issues could be about a positive advancement in agriculture that is ‘fixing’ an issue or a negative development that hinders agriculture. They were asked to consider:For their final product, they were asked to create a 1:30–2:00 minute long edited video, using images, video clips, and a voiceover.Our goal was to keep the video editing expectations simple for this project. Since most of our ninth grade students had not used WeVideo to this point, we decided we would ease them into things by having them start in the simpler Storyboard Mode. However, we found that most students ended up switching to the more robust, feature-rich Timeline Mode to make use of multiple tracks, custom animations, control of track and music volume, and more. Our students were able to make use of the vast, royalty-free library available in WeVideo in creating their projects.We had students use this tutorial to get started on their project:Students were assessed on:Here are a couple of final PSA projects that our ninth graders produced:DC Food Dessertsdrive.google.comAgricultural Land Declinedrive.google.comIt was awesome to see students get creative beyond the scope of the project. Some students went the extra mile, and it showed in the final product. There are always things you don’t expect when assigning a project the first time around, and for this one, it was pretty great to see how many students intuitively figured out some of the more advanced features WeVideo has available, even though it wasn’t in the tutorial we provided them.Another highlight related to a student who was absent when her group started the project. This student asked if she could work independently so that she could pursue an idea for the video project that she had. And so she did just that! Talk about not looking for an easy way out. It was fun to see student express their creativity in creating their PSA’s.----Educator | Keynote speaker | Consultant | Author: Tech with Heart | #EdTech Enthusiast | NAIS Teacher of the Future | linktr.ee/StaceyRoshanStacey Roshan--Stacey Roshan--Stacey Roshan--Stacey Roshan--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Stacey Roshan,https://medium.com/,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*YXLZKSz1z_g5nrOqQ8kfqw.png",3,3
359,18251,https://medium.com/@allansendagi/my-javascript-journey-f7f3117ea146?source=tag_archive---------162-----------------------,My Javascript Journey,But how does Javascript Work?,"Allan SendagiFollow--ListenShareSo how does Javascript work? To be able to answer this question well, we will need to understand the following concepts:Because Javascript can be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained. YDKJ book series.We know that to have a working program especially in Javascript, we don’t need to know the internal workings of the language.But it is important to learn.A program has to do some simple things:- It has to allocate memory for created variables or files on our computer.- It also has to parse and execute scripts — read and run commands.We have previously talked about the javascript engine that each browser implements. Chrome we said has the V8 engine. It reads the javascript that we write and changes it into machine executable instructions for the browser.The engine consists of two parts:- A memory heap- Call stackThis is where memory allocation happens. To allocate memory in the memory heap, all we have to do is to create a variable.Now, the javascript engine is going to remember that c has a value of 2; we’ve just used up the memory heap!Memory LeakSuppose I kept creating these variables in this order:The issue with this is I am creating all these global variables in the memory heap; but we can only have a limited amount of memory in the memory heap.So by increasing the number of variables that we have — imagine if I had a page full of variables and instead of just numbers, they’re big arrays — this will create whats known as a memory leak.A memory leak happens when you have unused memory, such as let’s say, we’re not using the variable c, but it’s still there. Well, by having unused memory just laying around, it fills up this memory heap. And that’s why you you have heard that global variables are bad.Global variables are bad because if we forget to clean up after ourselves, we fill up this memory heap and eventually the browser will not be able to work.This is where your code is read and executed. It tells you where you are in the program.What the call stack does is it reads the first line — console.log(1) — puts it in the call stack. The javascript engine sees that console.log(1) has been added, so it runs it and creates 1. The engine then says, OK, I am removing console.log(1) as I have just finished running it, I’m going to place console.log(2) into the call stack. It repeats the same process — execute and remove — with console.log(2) and console.log(3) until the call stack is empty.But let’s have a bit more of a complex example here to demonstrate this point.If I run this in the console:I get 4! So what happened here according to the Call Stack?We ran the one function first; then function two…and then console.log (4) that’s run inside of the two function. So now that we read this, the call stack is going say, OK, there’s nothing else inside of the call stack. I’m going to run console.log(4). So it’s going to print out number 4 here.Now the engine is going to remove that from the call stack, and then remove the two function and then remove the one function. And the call stack is now empty.So why is Javascript a single threaded language that can be non blocking? Single threaded means that it has only one call stack. And with one call stack only, it can only do one thing at a time.And as you saw, a call stack is first in-last out.So whatever is at the top of the call stack gets run first then below that.. below until the call stack is empty.Now, other languages can have multiple call stacks and these are called multithread.You can also see how that might be beneficial to have multiple call stacks, so that we don’t keep waiting around for stuff.Well, running code on a single thread can be quite easy, since you don’t have to deal with complicated scenarios that arise in multithreaded environment — you just have one thing to worry about. Issues with multithreaded environment can be things like deadlocks. And that is what synchronous programming means.Synchronous programming simply means, line one gets executed then line two gets executed and then line three gets executed.The latter, can’t start before the first finishes, so the console.log (2), doesn’t start until console.log(1) finishes. And console.log(3) doesn’t start until these above two finish.Stack overflow is when a stack is overflowing. It is kind of like we talked about memory leaks and how the memory heap of a javascript engine can overflow.Well, with stack overflow, this happens when the call stack just gets bigger and bigger and bigger until it just doesn’t have enough space anymore.And can we recreate a stack overflow?Yes!What is happening here is something called recursion. Recursion means a function that calls itself. So if you look at the above function, we run foo and foo gets executed; and what foo does inside the function is run foo again!So it just keeps looping over and over and over, having recursion but there is no end in sight.We keep adding foo to the call stack.So if we keep adding it, over and over and over and over, thats when we get a stack overflow.So, now we know that the javascript engine — the V-8 engine in Chrome — has a memory heap and a call stack. We also know that Javascript is single threaded — only one statement is executed at a time.Now what if line two was a big task we needed to do? Maybe loop through an array that had millions of items, what would happen there?We would have to wait around a long time until line 3 executes; and in the mean time we wouldn’t be able to do anything. And in our small example that doesn’t mean much but if we had this on a Website, the user wouldn’t be able to do anything.The web site would pretty much freeze until that task is done and the user just waits there.Well with synchronous task, if we have one function that takes up a lot of time, it’s going to hold up the line.And thats when the need for non blocking arises. So Javascript as a single threaded language that can be nonblocking.What this means is that ideally we don’t wait around for things that take time.We can use asynchronous programming to rescue us.Think of asynchronous like a behaviour. Synchronous execution is great because it’s predictable. We know what happens first then what happens next. What happens third.But it can get slow as we have seen. So when we have to do things like image processing or making requests over the network like API calls,we need something more than just synchronous tasks.The question then becomes; how do we do asynchronous programming then?setTimeout is a function that comes within our browsers, and it allows us to create a timeout. And we can just give it the first parameter as the function that we want to run, and the second parameter is how many seconds we want to wait. In this case we are waiting for 2 seconds(2000ms); lets run this and see what happens.Here we have console.log(1), console.log(3) and then console.log(2) — two seconds later.And thats what asynchronous programming is. In order to understand what has just happened, lets take a look at the diagram below.In order for javascript to run, we need more than just a javascript engine. We need what we call a javascript runtime environment — which is part of the browser and its included in all the browsers. The browsers have extra things, on top of the engine — web APIs, callback queue and an event loop.And setTimeout is part of the web API — its what the browsers give us to use, so we can do asynchronous programming .So looking at the above diagram, lets see if we can figure out what our code was doing:1. console.log(1) goes into the call stack; it gets run and we log it to the browser. 2. Then we get setTimeout into our call stack — because we finished the first task, we’re going to the second one. Once setTimeout is in the call stack, it triggers the web API(setTimeout is not part of javascript but part of the web API, it has special characteristics). After setTimeout has been called, and the web API notified, it is poppedvout of the call stack.Now, the web API starts with a timer here, a timer of two seconds.It’s going to know that in two seconds, you have to do something. And because the call stack is empty, the javascript engine now goes to console.log(3) and executes this.Now we’ve done 1 and 3 but we still have setTimeout 2 seconds in the web API.Now after two seconds when our time limit is up, the web API is going to say, okay, setTimeout should be run.Let’s see what’s inside of it. Well we have a console.log(2). So what’s going to happen is, it’s going to say, hey! set time is done.We have a callback, and this callback of setTimeout we added to the callback que.Now, the last part, the event loop checks and says, hey! is the call stack empty? — and it keeps checking all the time.If the stack is empty and there’s nothing running right now the javascript engine, it’s going to say, hey! do we have any callbacks?It’s going to check the callback que and say, hmm! is anything in there?, because the call stack is empty, we can throw something in there and make it do some work.In our case we say, oh yeah! I do.Let me put this into the call stack.So now we move the callback into the call stack and run it. Then we have console.log(2).And again we’re done with the callback, so we remove it.We’re done.Everything is empty and we’ve just run this 1, 3; It’s going to go through the entire web API callback que event loop. And then it’s going to run console.log(2).So let’s recap.If you wanted to load your latest tweets onto a web page and you do this synchronously, then visitors to your site won’t be able to do anything until those tweets are loaded.This could cause a long delay before they even get to see the content of the site. They may not be able to click anywhere and the page will feel like it’s frozen.Another way to think about this is calling your teacher with a question.Synchronous way is you called the teacher, you wait on the phone until the teacher answers the phone and ask him the question and hopefully get an answer.So you let the phone ring until he picks up. But you’re not doing anything else in the mean time.Asynchronous means that you send a text to a teacher with a question. And then when the teacher, he or she has the time, will respond to you and call you with the answer. So you can do other stuff in between. Javascript is asynchronous when you can leave it a message and a callback tells you, hey! Mr. teacher has a message for you when you’re not too busy.And that’s why we call it a callback function and a callback que. We’re calling back to let her know that there’s some stuff waiting for you.----Technology will save Homo Sapiens from extinction.

Chatbots will work similar to the other voice assistants in vogue like Siri, Alexa, Cortana. The Chatbots will use AI tech to access costumer data, records, and sales purchases to make better uniformed conversation. Advertisement is one field which uses tech to push ads and conversation with the prospective consumers.Improve Customer Engagement:Companies that offer multiple products and services have the maximum benefit scope of Chatbots. Immediate engagement is the game changer. Here, below our AI powered Chatbots interacts with the user and offers him the flights at the best rate for a travel destination.5 Reasons why Chatbots will be the future of Digital Economy:Chatbots and Customers are interlinked:The modern consumer is online and surfing through your website and products at any random time. Modern consumers are accessing the website through mobile, tablet, desktop or maybe using Alexa too. The consumer is modern and self aware, firms also needs to be at the same level of technical proficiency. Chatbots is one option to do that. Chatbots offers a unique 24/7 engagement experience across platforms to help the firms get in new clients.Increasing Engagement/InteractionFrom the monotonous yes/no to imitating human agent conversation flow, Chatbots have come a long way. Meaningful opening line to interesting lines to engage the user to emojis, Chatbots are now driving forward the conversation and keeping the visitors hooked on the website.Managing the high consumer flowOften, there would be a huge spike in a website that would put the human resources deployed to engage the users under a huge strain. Educational websites will see a spike of student’s visitor during the exam time period. Chatbots can handle the multiple queries and give uniform standardized Interactions.Find New LeadsThe global chatbot market is expected to exceed $1.34 billion valuation by 2024 according to multiple reports. The market is going to explode and a chance to gain a foothold is something every firm will take a heed. Chatbots have simply ceased being a new tech tool to a solution bringing new customers who were just visitors/traffic on the website. An automated robust Customer service is one segment which will be a big part of the E-Commerce or Service focused firms. Chatbots would solve customer general queries and translate those customers into a new consumer base for the websites.Cost Optimization/24*7*365 AvailabilityChatbots are powered by AI and Machine Learning; they resolve tickets raised by the consumer’s swift enabling customer satisfaction. Chatbot reduces the cost for the company in hiring resources who needs to be deployed in shifts to tackle the vast number of queries arising on the website.So, what’s ahead for the Chatbots?Future looks rosy for the Chatbots as the firm’s looks forward to engage with the consumers and market their product effectively. Chatbots are critical in bringing new business as they will interact in the form of automated chats with new visitors/people thus translating to more sales, financial transactions and revenues. Chatbots possess the inherent capacity to interact with more number of consumers than the normal human agents who are live on the site would be able to do. As Machine learning advances, we won’t be able to identify the conversation of a Chatbot from the human agent would normally do. Retail Consumer Goods Industry, e-commerce, travel & hospitality are some of the industries where Chatbots would be making a huge impact.----IntelliTicks is a hybrid chatbot platform that combines human agents and AI for delivering better customer experience.IntelliTicksinChatbots Life--2IntelliTicksinChatbots Life--2IntelliTicksinMyTake--IntelliTicksinChatbots Life--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347LucianoSphereinTowards AI--14Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Rita Batalha--4Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",IntelliTicks,https://medium.com/@intelliticks,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*qUOEAfX2PTB6OySIR7KjBQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HT1ZPLaLtqqsexYHNciZmw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Zs6bWAssLlFl06qH8aiysQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*L1-Cstca6d70ayqpPHL_3g.png",5,0

To compile the index Google surveys hundreds of journals and websites that meet its inclusion guidelines, along with leading conferences in Engineering & Computer Science.In a blog post last Friday Google released its 2019 Scholar Metrics, designed to “provide an easy way for authors to quickly gauge the visibility and influence of recent articles in scholarly publications …to help authors as they consider where to publish their new research.” One of the top AI conferences — IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) ranked in the top 10 for the first time, up from 20th in 2018. The world’s most prominent scientific journals, Nature and Science, ranked first and third respectively.Google Scholar uses the following as the foundation for the Metrics:Publications with fewer than 100 articles or that have no citations are not included.The Scholar Metrics divide publications into various categories (Engineering & Computer Science, Humanities, Literature & Arts, etc.), and display the top 20 publications for each category. It is also possible to view each publication’s top papers.Take Nature as an example, three of its top-five cited papers are AI-related: Deep Learning by the Turing Award laureates Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton; and Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning and Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search,both from DeepMind.Synced notes that 6 well-known AI conferences appear in the Metrics’ overall listing:In the subcategory “Artificial Intelligence,” 7 of 20 on the list are AI conferences:The Metrics also include AI-related subcategories such as Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, Computational Linguistics, Human Computer Interaction, and Robotics.It should come as no surprise to attendees that AI conferences are publishing so prodigiously — in recent years they have evolved from low-key academic gatherings into extravagant multimedia events attracting thousands and serving as showcases for major innovations and breakthroughs in AI research, development, and deployment.The 2019 Google Scholar Metrics are available on scholar.google.Journalist: Fangyu Cai | Editor： Michael Sarazen2018 Fortune Global 500 Public Company AI Adaptivity Report is out!Purchase a Kindle-formatted report on Amazon.

368,47722,https://medium.com/@UpGuard/what-is-cybersecurity-risk-a-thorough-definition-47dc68579a4c?source=tag_archive---------169-----------------------,What Is Cybersecurity Risk? A Thorough Definition,None,"UpGuardFollow--1ListenShareCybersecurity risk is the probability of a cyber attack or data breach on your organization.Organizations are becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats due to the increasing reliance on computers, networks, programs, social media and data globally. Data breaches, a common cyber attack, have massive negative business impact and often arise from insufficiently protected data.Global connectivity and increasing use of cloud services with poor default security parameters means the risk of cyber attacks from outside your organization is increasing. What could historically be addressed by IT risk management and access control now needs to complimented by sophisticated cyber security professionals, software and cybersecurity risk management.It’s no longer enough to rely on traditional information technology professionals and security controls for information security. There is a clear need for threat intelligence tools and security programs to reduce your organization’s cyber risk and highlight potential attack surfaces.Decision-makers need to make risk assessments when prioritizing third-party vendors and have a risk mitigation strategy and cyber incident response plan in place for when a breach does occur.Cybersecurity refers to the technologies, processes and practices designed to protection an organization’s intellectual property, customer data and other sensitive information from unauthorized access by cyber criminals. The frequency and severity of cybercrime is on the rise and there is a significant need for improved cybersecurity risk management as part of every organization’s enterprise risk profile.Regardless of your organization’s risk appetite, you need to include cybersecurity planning as part of your enterprise risk management process and ordinary business operations. It’s one of the top risks to any business.Return to table of contentsAlthough general IT security controls are useful, they are insufficient for providing cyber attack protection from sophisticated attacks and poor configuration.The proliferation of technology enables more unauthorized access to your organization’s information than ever before. Third-parties are increasing provided with information through the supply chain, customers, and other third and fourth-party providers. The risk is compounded by the fact that organization’s are increasingly storing large volumes of Personally identifiable information (PII)on external cloud providers that need to be configured correctly in order to sufficiently protect data.Another factor to consider is the increasing number of devices that are always connected in data exchange. As your organization globalizes and the web of employees, customers, and third-party vendors increases, so do expectations of instant access to information. Younger generations expect instant real-time access to data from anywhere, exponentially increasing the attack surface for malware, vulnerabilities, and all other exploits.Unanticipated cyber threats can come from hostile foreign powers, competitors, organized hackers, insiders, poor configuration and your third-party vendors. Cyber security policies are becoming increasing complex as mandates and regulatory standards around disclosure of cybersecurity incidents and data breaches continues to grow, leading organizations to adopt software to help manage their third-party vendors and continuously monitor for data breaches.The importance of identifying, addressing and communicating a potential breach outweighs the preventive value of traditional, cyclical IT security controls.Data breaches have massive, negative business impact and often arise from insufficiently protected data. External monitoring through third and fourth-partyvendor risk assessments is part of any good risk management strategy. Without comprehensive IT security management, your organization faces financial, legal, and reputational risk.Return to table of contentsCybersecurity is relevant to all systems that support an organization’s business operations and objectives, as well as compliance with regulations and laws. An organization will typically design and implement cybersecurity controls across the entity to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information assets.Cyberattacks are committed for a variety of reasons including financial fraud, information theft, activist causes, to deny service, disrupt critical infrastructure and vital services of government or an organization.The six common sources of cyber threats are as follows:To understand your organization’s cyber risk profile, you need to determine what information would be valuable to outsiders or cause significant disruption if unavailable or corrupt.It’s increasingly important to identify what information may cause financial or reputational damage to your organization if it were to be acquired or made public. Think about personally identifiable information (PII)like names, social security numbers and biometric records.You need to consider the following as potential targets to cyber criminals:Return to table of contentsCybersecurity risk management is generally set by leadership, often including an organization’s board of directors in the planning processes. Best-in-class organizations will also have a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who is directly responsible for establishing and maintaining the enterprise vision, strategy and program to ensure information assets and customer data is adequately protected.Common cyber defence activities that a CISO will own include:When an organization does not have the scale to support a CISO or other cybersecurity professional, board members with experience in cybersecurity risk are extremely valuable.That said, it is important for all levels of an organization to understand their role in managing cyber risk. Vulnerabilities can come from any employee and it’s fundamental to your organization’s IT security to continually educate employees on how to avoid common security pitfalls that can lead to data breaches or other cyber incidents. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s ( NIST) Cybersecurity Framework provides best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.Return to table of contentsCybersecurity risk management is a long process and it’s an ongoing one. Your organization can never be too secure. Cyber attacks can come from stem from any level of your organization, so it’s important to not pass it off to IT and forget about it.In order to mitigate cyber risk, you need the help of every department and every employee.If you fail to take the right precautions, your company and more importantly your customers data could be a risk. You need to be able to control third-party vendor risk and monitor your business for potential data breaches and leaked credentials continuously.Return to table of contentsUpGuard helps companies like Intercontinental Exchange, ADP, The New York Stock Exchange, IAG, First State Super, Akamai, Morningstar and NASA protect their data and prevent breaches.We can help you c ontinuously monitor, rate and send security questionnaires to your vendors to control third-party risk and improve your security posture.To prevent breaches, avoid regulatory fines and protect your customers trust who UpGuard BreachSight’s cyber security ratings and continuous exposure detection.We can also help you automatically create an inventory, enforce policies, and detect unexpected changes to your IT infrastructure.Book a demo todayor watch our data leak detection webcast.Originally published at https://www.upguard.com.----1https://www.upguard.com — UpGuard combines third-party security ratings, vendor questionnaires, and threat intelligence in a single cyber risk solution.UpGuard--UpGuard--UpGuard--UpGuard--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--227Scott H.

369,18861,https://medium.com/syncedreview/a-look-at-chinas-growing-semiconductor-industry-eab7154615fc?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,A Look at China’s Growing Semiconductor Industry,None,"SyncedFollowSyncedReview--ListenShareIn February Chinese AI semiconductor maker Horizon Robotics raised US$600 million in Series B funding from SK China, SK Hynix and big auto groups, making it the first in its field to reach the staggering valuation of US$3 billion. Company CEO Kai Yu, a former Dean of Baidu Institute of Deep Learning, says Horizon’s next goal is to become the “Intel of edge computing” in areas such as intelligent driving and AIoT.Market intelligence company Tractica forecasts the global deep learning chipset market will surge from US$1.6 billion in 2017 to US$66.3 billion by 2025. While many Chinese startup companies focus on AI applications, Horizon Robotics is among the few tackling hardware infrastructure, where China currently falls short.Most Chinese semiconductor startups are operating on a net loss, and analysts expect this may last into the next two years. Further, the United States has placed export controls on close to a dozen AI and machine learning technologies. Chinese semiconductor companies are however catching up, propelled by multiple government policies, a firm push in R&D, and massive capital injection.There are two primary application fields Chinese chip companies cater to: Security and Smartphones. China will have over 600 million security cameras by 2020. The country’s compound annual growth rate for Security from 2018–2022 is estimated at 22.6 percent, with wide-range applications in public security, urban transportation, eco-architecture and industrial parks.Chips are the most expensive component in video surveillance. A typical device set requires four types of chips: two types of SoC accelerators, one for deep learning, and an ISP chip. Most current AI chip solutions use GPUs, but more FPGA/ASIC solutions emerging for example from Cambricon and DeePhi, while Huawei Hisilicon has become a big player in specialized SoC.The other market worth watching is smartphones, where AI is the new buzzword. The Huawei Mate 10 and Glory V10 for example have the cutting-edge Huawei Neural Processing Unit (NPU) Kirin 970. Marketing gimmick or not, AI integration has dramatically increased in Chinese smartphone applications since 2017. Facial recognition, beauty cams, VR applications and voice assistants are now common smartphone features. Strategy Analytics predicts 90 percent of smartphones will be equipped with AI assistants by 2023.Deep learning requires massive computing resources, and CPUs are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to images and video processing. At the moment the most compatible chips for deep learning training are GPUs produced by NVIDIA and AMD. The chips are however quite expensive and power consuming. The next best option is FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), which are commonly used for deep learning inferencing and manufactured by companies such as Xinlinx, Lattice, and Intel Altera. These adaptive, semi-customized chips have lower consumption and latency, but fall short with floating point speed and can have complicated wiring issues.An emerging option is ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are are fully customizable, but whose initial implementation is also relatively costly. ASICs are being developed by multiple tech companies such as Google TPU, Huawei Hisilicon, and Amazon’s ASIC. Meanwhile, the Google third generation TPUs that power TensorFlow enable more advanced ML instructions per watt than commercial GPUs or FPGAs.The edge computing market is expected to represent more than three-quarters of the total market opportunity, aside from cloud and data centre environments. Chinese startups lack the experience of large semiconductor companies with CPU, GPU and FPGA designs, therefore ASICs are seen as a catch-up opportunity. Current Chinese companies in this field include:With AI deployment rapidly spreading to cars, phones, drones and robots, China recently launched a Science and Technology Innovation Board (STIB) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) — something like Nasdaq in the US. As the SSE explains on its official website, “establishing a sci-tech innovation board and piloting the registration system is a key reform initiative for the capital market.” With markets open and ready for the next mega chip company to emerge, Chinese hopefuls will need to withstand foreign competition while developing their own advantages and demonstrating profitability.Localization: Meghan Han | Editor: Michael Sarazen2018 Fortune Global 500 Public Company AI Adaptivity Report is out!Purchase a Kindle-formatted report on Amazon.

370,8133,https://medium.com/@TechChill/children-and-technology-raising-the-next-it-generation-582de090f2ed?source=tag_archive---------129-----------------------,Children and technology — raising the next IT generation,None,"TechChillFollow--ListenShareFor many parents, it’s not clear how to create a positive experience with technology for their children. On one side, there are countless studies which showcase the numerous risks that children are exposed to when spending too much time in front of the screen. However, even now we already see that in the job market IT experts are one of the most sought-after professions and studies have shown that this trend is only going to become more pronounced in the future. Technology is already a fundamental part of our little one’s daily life, which serves not only for their entertainment but also helps them learn new skills, expand their knowledge base about various subjects, helps them find information more effectively and enables them to have numerous conversations.Before we all gather at TechChill, we asked the Learn IT Co-founder Linda Sinka about the role of technology in children’s lives, and the benefits that it brings.“Overall, children show huge interest in tech. Their abilities to operate with touchscreens are impressive. If you will give children the chance to solve classwork, or any other schoolwork for that matter, with the help of tech they will be excited. If in the study process tech would be integrated much more broadly, say, in different study subjects, children would have more motivation to study and as such the results would be better. To encourage children to choose IT as their specialty, it’s important to create this interest at a young age. High school might be too late because stereotypes about how complicated IT is are already formed and they get scared,” emphasized Learn IT C0- founder Linda Sinka.What’s the benefit of technology for children?By learning the basics of programming, students improve their logic and algorithmic thinking, creativity, and cooperation. Thanks to modern programming environments, students can learn to make interactive stories, games, animations, web-pages, mobile apps, and other programs. Even if the child doesn’t choose IT as a profession, the skills they learn will be transferable to other topics of interest. Here, the same principle applies as taking your kid to sports practices, music school or art school; by taking part in these activities, you don’t immediately assume that the child will become a professional athlete, musician or artist. Instead, all of these activities develop a new skillset and help the child understand what they enjoy and would like to learn in the future at a higher level.What is the best approach to teach programming to children?Learn IT is a programming school for children which offers 4 study programs for kids ranging from 1st grade to 9th grade of elementary school. In 4 years, children without prior knowledge of programming learn such programming languages as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the lessons is to inspire them to create new technologies and to give them a foundational understanding of different programming environments. The lessons take place once a week for 90 minutes during the regular school year. Additionally to the regular lessons, Learn IT students participate in various IT competitions and during the summer — in camps about programming and entrepreneurship.What kind of tech do you use in the process?Mostly the lessons take place in front of a computer where the children learn different programming environments. Additionally, to showcase the possibilities of programming outside a computer and to broaden their skill set, there are lessons where kids can work with programmable electronics and robots. This year Learn IT has a new program “Electronics and 3D printing” for the older children. In this program, students can work on their own meaningful projects and gain practical knowledge of 3D modeling and develop their ideas on an Arduino microcontroller.What do children say about it? How to inspire them?Children are already ready to learn about technologies in preschool. They want to explore, they are not afraid to make mistakes and, when they don’t understand something, they ask for help. No matter what kind of tech it is, be it a driving robot, or a small mobile game that they can give to their parents to play through, children are excited about tech. A proper programming environment can only motivate them to explore modern technologies on their own.Experience shows that even in preschool children are creative and can generate ideas and find technological solutions. One year ago, we organized a hackathon and the ideas were very different — a program that wakes up a snoring dad, a game with the goal of training reaction speed, or a program that helps children socialize. During the event, the participating children were very appreciative of the opportunity to realize their own ideas.What’s the international experience, data, statistics?International experience shows that an increasing number of schools are changing to digital learning platforms. This is especially true in science subjects where with the help of online learning environments, children are presented various different tasks and with the help of tech, they can identify problem-questions faster. If 10 years ago computer-related subjects (IT) taught from 5th grade, then today, in most of the schools, IT is taught from the 1st grade, even in Latvia. An increasing number of schools are starting in inquire about the newest technologies — robots, 3D printers, and virtual reality classes. For example, in the United Kingdom, with the help of virtual reality, kids learn about volcanoes and their classification.Future Founders playgroundAlready next week around 2000 participants from all around the world will come together at TechChill. For the second year in a row, with the goal of making tech conferences more welcoming to parents and to support the tech education of children, there will be the Future Founders Playground. It will not only be a relaxing area for new parents but also a playground for the little ones with regular workshops for preschool and elementary school age children which will be lead by experts from our friends Learn IT, RoboHUB and Virtual VR.All parents with a valid TechChill 2019 pass are welcome to use the facilities at Future Founders playground and sign up for workshops. In the free workshops, children will be able to learn the basics of programming and robotics, become familiar with Virtual reality (VR) and try out various new gadgets and innovations. Kids under the age of 12 can attend the event for free if accompanied by an adult or a guardian with a valid ticket on hand.

There seems to be a deep curiosity in people about computer simulations and the possibility that we may be living in one. Everything from coincidences in sports games to weird news events get used as “proof the simulation is real”. Why are we fascinated with the idea that our existence is part of some simulation?Elon Musk constantly defends the possibility that we could be living in a simulation. Musk is a very influential human being having built some of the most technologically advanced companies of this century. When he says something, whether he is joking or not, people tend to take it seriously.People seriously believe we are living in a simulation. I mean some people still believe the world is flat but that a discussion for another day. I can not sit by and imagine we live in a simulation. There is really no definitive proof in the positive direction of the argument. It is hard to imagine living inside a computer similar to the machines we have created. In twenty years we are going to look at the computers we are using right now and be confused. As the computers we use increase in power and connectivity maybe then will we have some simulation type technology that will be able to come close to reality.Video games and virtual experiences have become more and more common place in the modern world. As these technologies become more and more the norm we will see more of this simulation talk. Its easy to see the parallel between a very high resolution video game made today and the possibility of simulation quality video games in thirty years. With the pace that technology has advanced over the past twenty years, it is honestly difficult to know exactly what to expect in the future. We can generalize and attempt to predict but we need to be prepared for anything. I mean anything.Augmented reality is slowly creeping into the social platforms. The virtual reality space is only just beginning. As this technology becomes more and more mainstream we are going to see a huge market develop behind virtual reality social environments. Digital spaces where people from all across the globe can meet and interact with each other. This technology will make the idea that we live in a computer seem not very far fetched.Even today in the very early stages of this digital revolution we have massive digital presences. These presences are in the form of social media accounts across a multitude of platforms. These social profiles contain data about our friends and social interactions. What kind of things we like. The items we buy. The videos we watch. The videos we do not watch. All of this data is used to create digital version of ourselves that are stored in databases. All of these independent tech companies have loads of data on you that they in turn use to deliver content you desire. This is the world we live in today. What will this look like in tens years?As we move forward into a more and more connected world we need to stand up for our personal data. People need to take their privacy into their own hands. If you want a completely private life then you probably should not have a social media account. Privacy is a choice, not a right. These platforms provide a service to the users in the form of social connection and interaction and in return the users pay the company in data. We need to understand and be okay with the data usage policies social platforms put in place.Information technology has the power to connect people in ways nothing we have now does. We must choose to use the technology platforms in positive ways. As we push forward further into the simulation like future we need to remember to use the technology for the betterment of ourselves and our environment.Its hard to envision a future that is not dominated by technology. As much as I would like to believe that we can have this perfect, green and sunny future, we have to come to terms with the damages we have done to the planet and to cultures.

It is more than that. It involves understanding the problem, devising algorithm (pattern, decomposition, abstraction) before writing and executing program.In this article I want to focus on how we can inculcate algorithmic thinking among kids. For this I will turn to interactive learning mechanism of education system and build up on day to day activities of kids.We can inculcate algorithmic thinking among kids by Interactive learning mechanism of education system & relationship with kids’ day to day activitiesAccording to Stanford University School of Medicine, ‘Interactive learning actively engages the students in wrestling with the material. It reinvigorates the classroom for both students and faculty. Lectures are changed into discussions, and students and teachers become partners in the journey of knowledge acquisition.’ More on interactive learning can be found here & here .With interactive learning, kids can be taught concepts by doing activitiesWhat it basically means is that with interactive learning, kids can be taught concepts by doing activities.For example, teaching addition and subtraction with apples. If we place kids in groups and hand over to them a set of apples of 2 or more colours and ask them to fill in a worksheet like below, they would grab the concepts by interacting with apples (as they would apply the concept in real life).This group activity is an established way of teaching kids concepts in addition and subtraction using activity. In future they will likely repeat this activity in the super market or use it while doing other addition/ subtraction in later life.Similarly concepts in science are increasingly taught through interactive learning.We propose to extend interactive learning to teach the concepts in algorithmic thinking.We propose to extend interactive learning to teach the concepts in algorithmic thinking.There are many concepts in algorithmic thinking that are an essential part of kids day to day activities. For examples, sequencing, conditionals, commands creation, loops etc.I used conditionals as my main example here for building the case. When a school bus cross a traffic signal, it stops at red light and moves on at green light.This is a classic case of conditionals with real impact. Let me show it in a code. See belowSo every kid has seen this in practical life, all education had to do is to give it into an organized form. In schools this can be converted in activities in the form of traffic lights instruction, card games, or board games.More examples on the same concept can be2. Marks: If your marks are less than 40 then you passed the examination else you failed.3. Basketball team: If your height is more than 1.5 meters then you are eligible for your college basketball team else not.These activities can be extended further in concepts such as loop and while.So we see, major concepts in algorithmic thinking are already present in life of kids. We need to make it more organized and systematized for kids to recognize these concepts and practice it.Major concepts in algorithmic thinking are already present in life of kids — we need to make it more organized and systematized for kids to recognize these concepts and practice itA4Algo is an initiative to create a formal system in place by working with schools and institutions through games and activities.

That no one understands what they agree to when they download invasive apps, when their phones record their conversations even when they aren’t actively using them, and that their seemingly innocuous social media posts are being used against them, sometimes to even influence how they think about particular issues.This is important, and I want to explore it further at another time. However, I feel like a lesser explored aspect is how technology can be better used to protect privacy.This concept is not a new one. The theory that privacy can be built into systems, programs, or basically any kind of function that collects information about people is something that has been around for years. What I have been increasingly curious about though, is that no one seems to have augmented this theory with a realistic analysis of how newer and faster technology actually is created.I need to first describe how the majority of existing privacy frameworks treat information flows as relatively linear — collection, use, disclosure, retention. The metaphor being that information goes in one door, something happens to it, and it might go out another door. The majority of systems, software, and apps, do not treat information or data like this. This gap is a major issue that I don’t believe is receiving adequate attention.Some people are working to address it though, and are closing that gap, for example, through the creation of new programming language that can integrate privacy protections into some of the largest existing software platforms. I stumbled on the work of Jean Yang and others very recently, who have made incredible strides to create the programming language that I described above.When I continued to research into the existing and current work in this area, I was incredibly excited, but also increasingly concerned. Over and over, the technological solutions (even those in relative infancy in terms of development) existed to protect people’s privacy when it simultaneously seems like there are few concrete steps being taken to reflect these solutions in regulation. That means that these solutions that exist and that they can be written into the code of so many of those technological tools that have become part of our everyday life, but aren’t — because no one actually has to. (Or possibly because it isn’t well understood, but I don’t think that applies equally to all circumstances.)And therein is my frustration, and also, my goal. To continue this research, to improve my understanding of progress in computer science and engineering, and to lay out how I believe regulation can become more effective in integrating these privacy solutions into systems, software, apps and more, as they are being imagined and discussed in coffee shops and boardrooms.This intersection of technology and policy is the future of privacy. Hopefully there are likeminded people out there, and I look forward to sharing what I learn here.----Interested in technology, privacy and the future of government.

Coincidence? I think not) and on this channel I found one of the videos to be quite interesting on Learn how to morph faces with a Generative Adversarial Network!. This story is a summary of the knowledge I gained from the said video and I hope by the end of this you will have a good understanding of the idea and may want to play around with it.The people in the image above DO NOT EXIST in real life, they are computer-generated and that, my friend, is the power of GAN. If this has caught your attention keep reading to know more about it.GAN has a very simple task to do, that is, to generate data from the scratch, data of a quality that can fool even humans.Invented by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014, this model consists of two Neural — Networks(Generator and Discriminator) competing with one another resulting in the generation of some authentic content.The purpose of two Networks may be summarised as to learn the underlying structure of the input database as much as possible and using that knowledge to create similar content which fits all the parameters to fit in the same category.As shown above, the input was that of human faces, where it learned exactly what it is that makes a human face, well, human. Using that understanding it generated random human faces which otherwise might have been real as well.This image is an oversimplified architecture of GAN, but it captures the complete essence of the concept.This is what happens in a single iteration of GAN:I. Generator:II. Discriminator:As users, we know if it was from the real or fake sample, and using this knowledge we can backpropagate a training loss in order for the discriminator to do its job much better.But as we know, the Generator is a Neural-Network as well, so we can backpropagate all the way to the random sample noise and thus help generate better images. By doing this, the same loss function works for both, the discriminator and the generator as well.The trick lies in balancing both of these networks during training. If done rightly, the discriminator will learn to distinguish even slight abnormalities while at the same time generator will learn to generate the most realistic outputs.The Generator and the Discriminator are in a mini-max game.In the above image, D(x) is nothing but the probability of an image being a “Real Sample” image.Here there is another function G(z), which is nothing but the output of the Generator, z the random latent input. The probability of the generated image is from “Real Sample” is calculated by Discriminator as D(G(z))For Discriminator we want:For Generator:This loss function is the backbone of the GAN Architecture, only by achieving a great balance between the two networks we get high-performing Generator and Discriminator.For those of you, who are interested in learning more about GAN in detail:You should know, that manipulating images in the pixel domain is much too tedious and difficult work, so instead, we will be playing with images in the latent space.Here comes then, our first obstacle, How? for any given image, can we find the latent vector which will always result in our query image? That is:For our first obstacle, the following solution works best:Here’s a video of the Second Part — Updating Latent Code Estimate :In the later part of the video, the changes are very less observable that is due to the latent code estimate converging to the query image’s code.OK, maybe not this one.We need to understand, the latent space of StyleGAN is a highly complex 512-Dimensional space.Here, every point represents a picture, and we need to find a pattern in this space. For example, how will moving along a certain direction in this space change the generated image?In the end, I would like to show another example where I changed the “age” attribute of an image of Emma Watson.Here’s a link to my GitHub repository where I have tried this, the videos are actual outputs of it.Big thanks to Arxiv Insight again, for covering such an interesting topic.Go ahead, give this a try yourselves.----The StartupJust a guy who loves technology, and wants to learn to create new and interesting stuff.Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Nitin SharmainThe Startup--91Nitin SharmainThe Startup--36Nitin SharmainThe Startup--21Cameron R.

From driverless cars to robots on the factory floor to Toyota’s $1 billion investment in AI-based self-driving technology and IBM Watson’s partnership with the General Motors OnStar platform, AI is all set to revolutionize the automotive industry. One of the most significant innovations in today’s automotive manufacturing industry is the development and proliferation of driverless cars or assisted driving.AI and machine learning are creating better possibilities for reading and analyzing data from vehicles. Carmakers collect vast amounts of data on traffic conditions and human responses to develop algorithms for self-driven cars and their assistive features. Another AI contribution that is making a huge noise in the market is the vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The idea of using AI is not restricted to just driverless cars but also has the potential to change the automotive manufacturing supply chain in an equally profound and effective way. AI gives cloud computing and cloud-based intelligence the ability to integrate many aspects of a consumer’s life via their vehicle. The integration of advanced analytics, big data, and other top technological platforms with AI, assist the automotive manufacturing companies in producing vehicles that primarily act as a command center for all driving-related innovations. With AI as an increasingly common technology platform, the automotive industry is set to experience significant changes in upcoming years in supply chain management and production.

The Future of Security Tokens,None,"Sparsh SinghalFollow--1ListenShareIt may be hard to believe, but soon you could earn a fraction of Cristiano Ronaldo’s earnings. You could own a few square metres of an apartment in Hong Kong or perhaps a stake in a collectible Formula 1 race car. Thanks to tokenization, the world is becoming increasingly fractionalized everyday, providing us with the ability to shape our own financial destiny.What would you buy first in a fractionalized world? Well, I am a huge fan of Manchester United and I would love to buy some MUFC tokens on blockchain.Whether you are deeply invested in cryptocurrencies or reading your first articles about blockchain, there’s no hiding that tokenization is one of the greatest visions of the 21st century. So, why don’t we clear our heads for a few minutes and imagine the possibilities that a tokenized future brings?In today’s world, every asset is identity-centric. That means your house, your car, your salary and your stocks are all tied to your name.When all these assets get tokenized, they can be broken into smaller ownership stakes. In other words, they can be fractionally owned by multiple parties. The asset is tokenized using security tokens. A security token is any cryptocurrency that pays dividends, profit shares or invests in a project with the expectation of profit. It derives its value from an underlying real world assets. For instance, a million dollar property could be divided into 100 security tokens, whereby each security token represents a 1% stake in the property and its future cash-flows such as rental.Since security tokens are classified as investment contracts, they are subject to government regulations.First, real-world assets are moved onto a blockchain. Then, tokens on the blockchain can be used to represent ownership or participation stake in these assets in the form of decentralized protocols. This allows tokens to be bought and sold on different exchanges. Ultimately, investors can invest in various illiquid assets such as real-estate and sports teams due to lower minimum-investment requirements.When an asset gets tokenized, one security token can represent a fraction of its value. Since security tokens are similar to tradable securities, this is similar to buying shares of a public company, except that it is on a blockchain.From an asset owner’s perspective:From an investor’s perspective:Furthermore, since the asset ownership details are stored on the blockchain, the investor’s public-private key pair forms a digital signature on the blockchain, separating his blockchain identity from his real identity. Hence, although transactions are visible on the distributed ledger, they cannot be traced back to the investor by an unauthorized party. This is a huge step towards data security.In addition to all this, asset tokenization has other benefits since they involve security tokens.From traditional assets such as bonds, commodities, venture capital funds and real-estate to exotic assets such as artwork, race horses, sports teams and celebrities, companies across the world are using blockchain technology to achieve the vision of a tokenized world.Globally, several companies have been working on tokenizing commercial and residential real estate. In October 2018, the first real-estate property in New York was tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. Another blockchain startup is working to allow diamonds to be traded like other commodities. Sellers can simply list their diamonds on the platform and deliver them to a custodian, who would release to the buyer upon completion of the transaction. We have also achieved fractionalization of exotic cars. Exotic cars are one of the best performing asset classes in the last decade and now they will be tradable on live auction platforms.Liquefy, the leading security token issuance platform in Asia, is focusing on tokenizing sports teams, allowing investors and fans to easily invest in their favorite clubs and players. There are various applications in the sports industry from purchasing a stake in a sports team to investing in the upbringing of your favorite young players.Clearly, the wave to tokenize everything is coming. Now, the question is: “What will you buy first?”----1Blockchain Analyst at LiquefySparsh SinghalinThe Capital Platform--Sparsh SinghalinThe Capital Platform--Sparsh Singhal--Sparsh Singhal--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--40PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Sparsh Singhal,https://medium.com/@sparshsinghal21,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*7e0nMv65hx56jONneFDphQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2edHLVEIjVHXo55rFjTChg.png",5,50

They participated as one of the u.lab-S teams with the idea to transform an old estate into a centre for land and people. This work was, and is, being done within the context of Scotland’s people call for land reform, a fairer society and action on climate change. Taking part in the u.lab-S journey generated a sharpened and clarified purpose for the Team Folk Land. They were able to rethink how they operated in order to put the land, and the marginalized people, at the heart of their work.Some of the emerging impacts include:WalesMembers of the u.lab Wales confronted a range of issues from access to finance for small businesses to climate emergency action. One team prototyped co-creation of a community-led adult learning curriculum in Blaenau Festiniog, Rondda Cynon Taff and Ely, Cardiff. Another group redesigned the National Health Service staff survey in order to sustain better conversations.For this group, one of the biggest outcomes was how the teams were working together. Having every voice heard, for example through check-in rounds, provided space for pausing, listening, and asking good questions. These teams found that listening deeply allowed for more effective collaboration. They found that when people take the time to listen to each other, the result ends up aligning with the intention. To listen deeply and to make space for all voices to be heard leads to effective collaboration and more efficient work.CanadaThe ET Group (ETG), a Toronto based technology company seeking to connect people to collaborate effectively. Through the u.lab-S journey, ETG applied Theory U co-sensing methods and systems thinking analysis to their initiative. They uncovered symptoms and the root issues at play, as well as alternative perspectives on challenges which they were facing. Taking these new ideas one step forward, into an action plan, ETG began prototyping in an open and playful manner. Key to prototyping is collaboration, experimentation, and learning.One prototype which ETG produced was the Personal Connection prototype. Essential to the Personal Connection prototype story was the notion that, as digitalization separates people from one another, humans desire and need communities and social connections. With this thought, the prototype aimed to reach non-participants, ETG members, and everyone in between. Keeping in mind the question of how collaboration, connection, and technology may weave together, ETG now has a new Teamwork and Relationships circle. Three main areas seem to have come into focus for the ETG:We invite you to join us in this capacity-building program through the Societal Transformation Lab. Together, we’re designing and building a global eco-system for profound societal and civilizational transformation. Consider joining u.lab 1x, a massive open online course (MOOC) that runs from September to December 2019 and takes participants on a journey from sensing and connecting to deeper sources of knowing to generate powerful prototype ideas.Read more about the innovation lab here and consider joining us for u.lab 2x, which will run from February to May of 2020.----Field of the Future BlogHannah ScharmerinField of the Future Blog--1Otto ScharmerinField of the Future Blog--10Otto ScharmerinField of the Future Blog--29Hannah ScharmerinField of the Future Blog--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Gemma Jiang, PhDinField of the Future Blog--Eric BensoninBootcamp--4Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Hannah Scharmer,https://medium.com/@hannah.scharmer,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*nYgcsYR9uaTmieJ9kfSCuw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EbYc-WcaJfxW89twYZzTtg.png",4,23

However, our mobiles can also help us to save and control where our money goes each month, through financial applications that allow us to keep an exhaustive control over the expenses made, and the savings achieved.There are many applications of this type on Google Play, but not all of them are worth it. In this article, we select the best ones that can be downloaded and used, and review their most important functions.Fintonic is one of the most famous finance applications used on Google Play. We have talked about it repeatedly, and stands out from the rest for being one of the few platforms that allow us to synchronize our bank accounts to automate the reports of expenses and savings, thus avoiding having to manually enter purchases, income or transfers.It has compatibility for the vast majority of Spanish banking entities, and offers interesting functions such as commission notice, duplicate receipts or product management such as insurance, cards or loans. It also offers a useful option to finance Amazon purchases at 0% interest.Another feature that we will not find in the rest of the alternatives is what Fintonic calls “FinScore”. It is the theoretical valuation that the banking entities have about us depending on several factors such as age, the balance in our accounts or the expenses, so that it is possible to access better conditions in case the valuation is high.Another good option to control all our savings and expenses from your mobile is Money Manager. This application stands out for its simplicity and ease of use, but still has interesting options for all those who want to know where your money is going.The app allows you to record any transaction made with a touch on the screen, and automatically generates expense and income reports with graphs that show our progress. It is also possible to make budgets and organize the different invoices either by periodicity or by category. There is also no option to set reminders.To know absolutely all the money you spend, and how you spend it, there are few better applications than Spendee. The app has been selected several times as one of the best in its category by the editors of Google Play, and is that its ability to generate infographics with income and expenses, all with a fantastic design and all the functions we might need to carry a control over our finances.Among its most important features, we find the possibility of synchronizing our banking entities to automate the control of expenses and revenues, budget planner, generation of reports and infographics, or the possibility of creating shared portfolios with friends and family. Of course, it also allows registering those purchases made with cash, so that nothing escapes us.If you use several devices and look for an app where you can record all the savings and expenses, 1Money is one of the best options. Since it offers synchronization in the cloud, it is possible to access data from anywhere and through any device.The app in question allows you to add transactions quickly and easily, and will automatically generate reports that show where the money is spent and how our savings account has grown over the weeks.Another tool that, like Fintonic and Spendee, offers synchronization with the main banking entities is Wallet. The application encourages us to get rid of forever of our spreadsheet or notebook where until now we have recorded all our expenses and savings, and to use its flexible control and planning system.The app is free, and among its functions includes the possibility of generating financial reports on accounts and cards, loan management, synchronization in the cloud, predefined templates and categories, and even the possibility of geographically labeling each transaction made.For Google, Money Lover was one of the best applications of the year 2017 … and it is not for less. We are facing one of the most complete financial tools that exist in Google Play, with synchronization in the cloud, budget planning, push notifications and expense management by categories.Other interesting functions of this application are the possibility of carrying out an exhaustive follow-up on debts and loans, the possibility of creating shared portfolios with friends or relatives, and even a “Travel Mode” for those travelers who will spend time in a country different from yours. To avoid loss of information, the app also allows creating backup copies in Dropbox, one of the most popular cloud storage services.We finish this selection with an application perhaps somewhat less known than the previous ones, but that will undoubtedly attract the attention of more than one by the number of functions included, as well as by its intuitive design and easy to use design. Moneyhero allows us to mark saving objectives, so that the application itself will tell us every moment how much money we can spend every day so as not to exceed the limit and thus be able to fulfill our goals.The app also stands out for its simplicity, and it is enough to indicate the monthly income, as well as the fixed expenses and the saving objective. From these data, the app will generate the variable of expenses that we should not pass. Unlike the previous apps, Moneyhero can be used totally free for 15 days, and after that time it will be necessary to purchase a Premium subscription of the platform.Originally published at TheStartupFounder.com.----TheStartupFounder.com--TheStartupFounder.com--TheStartupFounder.com--TheStartupFounder.com--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Unbecoming--768HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",TheStartupFounder.com,https://medium.com/@aleb,1,4,0

This potential is born from the function it has and is then related to how much consumers need for the product. In the world of technology, many types of technology have been created but not all are able to master the technology trading market. The technology that was created indeed carries new and most sophisticated functions in its field. Increasingly, technology development will be even greater. The function in it no longer merely supports a simple scope but has entered a larger scale. The ability of a technology to master the market must be adapted to the strategy so that it can lead to the right target. The potential possessed by technology must be able to bring meaningful changes to human survival.XR in the GameWhen talking about Extended Reality (XR) technology, we will immediately imagine a game played by a person or group of people who use special digital devices such as glasses. This type of game is being overwhelmed by young people and even this game has reached a more serious level. Because of the high public interest in the game that carries this XR technology, a number of parties hold prize tournaments through XR games. Recently we have been surprised by the presence of the HADO game which is one example of a game that applies AR technology. This game combines eSport elements in it because it is played by a number of people who compete in one arena. In this game, every player seems to be fighting with their opponents in a setting that is exclusively designed to form the battle arena. Of course this is virtual and not real. We will only know about the real game arena after using AR headset devices, one of which is in the form of a Samsung smart phone. This tournament is not just to fulfill the desire to play but also to adopt a healthy lifestyle through play. If so far we have only sat in front of the screen for hours, with the presence of this kind of HADO game we will be directly involved in the battle arena and move as if we were fighting.XR in the Product Sales MarketThe application of XR technology is dominated by games, but this does not rule out the possibility for XR to be able to expand its functions to other fields. One possibility of using XR technology is in the field of trade. In trade, this technology can be used as an advertising medium. Some types of products that have adopted advertisement models using XR technology include cosmetics, transportation equipment, household furniture, and so on. Ads that use XR technology will look hundreds of times more interesting than the ads that we generally see. XR will make the advertising media seem real and more alive. The concept displayed is also more interesting where consumers will be involved more interactively in the ad. One example that we can see is in a Land Rover advertisement that places banner ads by including XR elements in it. The results, consumers seem to get a car key and can drive the advertised car. Consumers will have experience as if driving a car to provide a more real driving sensation. This is a smart concept where users will have more opportunities to consider purchasing these products after they have tested their use virtually. Other smart advertising concepts will soon be witnessed after XR technology dominates the advertising market. This function will be obtained through Gofind XR and further developments will continue to strive to improve its function.XR on Social MediaThe application of XR technology in the world of social media will show significant changes, especially in terms of features supported in it. XR technology has actually been encountered before on well-known social media applications, such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. However, the three are still using AR technology. The effects and filters that we have used before uploading photos to make them look more attractive are actually part of the role of AR technology. This technology makes the objects in the photo look more real by playing a color balance that is able to show a more beautiful side of the photo. This technology will be directly connected with the camera sensor and will capture clearer images. The popularity of AR technology will be defeated by the presence of the XR which will be more resilient in surpassing the previous sophistication.Thank you, please check out their website for more information https://www.gofindxr.com/Bounty0x: trun----Viva trun--Viva trun--Viva trun--Viva trun--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Viva trun,https://medium.com/@vivatrun66,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*oeaDzKtrngo48MEOwxynMA.png",4,0

This is a job that requires responsibility, tech, and soft skills, precision and patience. Because of all these skills, developers (especially good ones) have the freedom to choose their workplace and projects and if there is something that they don’t like about their work, they can easily switch their employer or career path.Something that has been observed recently, is that more and more developers choose to leave their jobs in big corporations and start working in Startups. Why?Well, Startup life is not for everyone. You have to be the kind of person who always wants more and more from themselves. Are you?If the answer is yes let’s see what are the advantages of working in a startup:As they grow, most small to mid-sized startups involve their team members in strategic decisions, or at the very least hold regular all-hands meetings where employees can ask questions and learn about what’s going on within the company. Employees have the license to show off their brilliance.In most jobs, a lot of the things you do are following procedures for what’s been done before. Most companies have a standard “way of doing things” for everything from manufacturing to marketing to putting together meeting agendas. And while new ideas are often welcome, they typically fall into a framework of how the company has operated in the past.At a startup, you’re building everything from scratch.And as you might imagine, designing, building, and creating require a completely different skill set than following or adapting a standard protocol.And as we all already know and see in today’s world, the ability to think beyond what’s been done before and “transdisciplinary thinking” — the ability to think beyond your functional role, are two of the key traits every worker needs to succeed in the future.The fact that the working group in a startup company is so small means that they must be in direct contact with the client themselves. And as you know, the more personal the relationship, the more you will learn about the needs of the client and the market. As a result, the priority will be to optimize the products and services and to be sure to satisfy the client.This is probably the most important section of the article. A startup is a great spot for both ambitious, hungry, go-getter type of person, and for people who are pleased by only doing their job well.If you want to become an entrepreneur one day and want to see what happens after your work as a developer is done and how your work helps people’s lives — go work in a Startup. You will be able to learn about business and processes directly from mentors, entrepreneurs and real-life experience. This enrichment is priceless.On the other hand, if you like your job as a developer in a Startup, you work on a brand new product with innovative technologies. You spend much more time writing code and scratching your head on challenging problems. The product is often a very exciting world-changing technology. You will be able to shift your skills and career.If you want to pursue a career as a software developer and to experience what is like to work with startups or/and on innovative projects, join our family!

Geeba ICO was launched — the joint venture between Airlift and n-Gon was agreed and set in to motion. Combining drones, droids and blockchain to deliver a innovative solution to last-mile delivery.2. Our first expo — In august we hosted a booth at The Blockchain Expo in Amsterdam. This was our first opportunity to deliver Geeba to the community and was a great success meeting lots of likeminded people.3. Completion of the Private Sale — We completed our private sale within 6 days and raised a huge $800k allowing us to move forward with Geeba and generating some excellent momentum.4. Listing on an exchange — We partnered with Latoken and got the GBA token posted on the exchange, allowing greater access to Geeba for the community and a significant milestone for any ICO, especially before the token sale has finished.5. Acceptance of Fiat currency — Another great partnership was formed with Indacoin allowing the community to invest in Geeba using fiat currency instead of just Cryptocurrency.6. The “Crypto Crash” — From November the crypto market took a hit making affecting trades, investors and ICO’s alike. It is no doubt this slowed the process for many, but it also allows those still standing to show strength and resilience. Geeba is here to stay and the Pre-Sale is still underway and we will continue to update you as things happen.As you can see from the Roadmap things will be moving forward in 2019, there have been some alterations in timescales in part due to the difficulties in the crypto market but we will be moving forward upon completion of the soft-cap.We are looking forward to bringing you more exciting content from our developments, expanding our team and bringing the Geeba E-commerce platform to life.Thank you for being a part of Geeba with us and keep watching for more updates soon.You can find the link to purchase tokens at our website geeba.io.James Thorp Director Of PR Geeba TechnologiesGeeba is going to revolutionize the delivery serviceGeeba is a new era of delivery service through robots, blockchain, and the community.

This process is often triggered when the customer needs are no longer satisfied by the current operations or products, and this is reflected in the company’s revenue. The resulting feeling of impending doom kicks off the metamorphosis cycle below, eventually leading to a transformation aimed at re-aligning the company with the customer needs. Impatience acts as a catalyst to accelerate the change in strategy, and at times, evolution of a company’s goals.This change can include immense amount of effort and a heft price tag, if the teams are historically operationalized within their functional silos. Once the driving goals behind a transformation are met, businesses that look to operationalize innovation and make it a part of their DNA stay relevant much longer. They keep the impatience alive, stay close to the customer and disrupt their business in a controlled manner with mini-transformations, before another hit to the revenue as the marketplace changes (think Amazon). The secret of success lies in reducing the duration it takes to complete each change cycle successfully and with a positive return.How do you operationalize innovation at your company?No matter where you are in your innovation and transformation journey, we collaborate with your teams to discover, define and deliver success specific to your vision, culture and business.© 2019 Emerald Technology Group Inc.

The functionality of the sensors can significantly increase food safety, the ability to identify even small dust specks and monitor environmental conditions such as temperature. Sensors can also deliver real-time data, thus guaranteeing optimal conditions highlighted by safety guidelines.IoT in Investigation:IoT technology can supervise and conduct superior quality tracking and can carry out investigations to pinpoint the exact location of contamination.Adding of Big Data:IoT, with the aid of Big Data technology, can analyze and assemble the data to recognize patterns of food-safety failures, assists in tracking failure points, and also predict the reason for food spoilage.Cultivators:Recognition of natural disasters, with the help of Big Data from historical patterns analysis, can result in preventing food-related accidents and utilizing products beneficially. Certain environmental conditions cannot be encouraged because of the contamination of food products that will result in them being branded unsafe for consumption.Genetic Indexing:Genetic Indexing can be carried out with Big Data technology as it differentiates and understands the correlation between DNA and RNA. IoT can be used to track the source of the bacteria, which is identified by Big Data.Storage safety with Big Data and IoT:Most of the food storage facilities face the same crisis — infestation with rats — that bring down the quality of the food product regardless of the source. Real-time data from the IoT sensors can be used to monitor, control, and prevent any conditions that jeopardize the quality of food products.

399,27902,https://medium.com/syncedreview/ringnet-3d-face-estimation-without-3d-supervision-c96a9d268d62?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,RingNet | 3D Face Estimation Without 3D Supervision,None,"SyncedFollowSyncedReview--ListenShare“The estimation of 3D face shape from a single image must be robust to variations in lighting, head pose, expression, facial hair, makeup, and occlusions. Robustness requires a large training set of in-the-wild images, which by construction, lack ground truth 3D shape.” (MPIIS).In a new paper accepted at CVPR 2019, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems introduce RingNet, an end-to-end trainable network which learns to compute 3D face shape from a single face image without 3D supervision. The researchers also built a new benchmark dataset and a 3D reconstruction benchmark challenge, NoW, both of which have been open-sourced on Github.The Max Planck Institute responded to Synced questions regarding their new paper, RingNet and the open challenge.How would you describe RingNet?RingNet is an end-to-end trainable network that enforces shape consistency across face images of the subject with varying viewing angles, light conditions, resolution, and occlusion. It is able to learn 3D face geometry from 2D images, but it only need single image for inference.Why does this research matter?The idea of RingNet is quite general even if it is only used for faces. One can potentially use this idea for other 3D reconstruction purposes. In this work, our researchers also introduce a 3D reconstruction benchmark challenge NoW and an evaluation metric to provide the research community with quantitative feedback which was lacking in this field. The aim is to encourage other researchers to participate in this challenge and go beyond visual comparisons.Since people can reconstruct a 3D face from single images with neck and full head, the technique can potentially be used for the animation industry or different face apps. There could be many interesting applications by combining RingNet and VOCA project (voice driven face animation model), for example, Using RingNet to prepare a template mesh for VOCA, then animate it with audio, i.e., a talking head from a face image.Could you describe the Challenge NoW in more detail?The goal of this benchmark is to measure the accuracy and robustness of 3D face reconstruction methods under variations in viewing angle, lighting, and common occlusions by a standard evaluation metric.The NoW Dataset introduced to run the challenge contains 2054 2D images of 100 subjects, captured with an iPhone X, and a separate 3D head scan for each subject. The head scans serve as ground truth for the evaluation. The subjects were selected to contain variations in age, BMI, and sex (55 female, 45 male).The challenge for all categories is to reconstruct a neutral 3D face given a single monocular image. Note that facial expressions are present in several images, which requires methods to disentangle identity and expression to evaluate the quality of the predicted identity.Can you identify any bottlenecks in the research?A bottleneck of the research topic is people tend to rely on only 2D landmarks. This certainly constrains the quality of the 3D reconstruction to some extent. Using dense correspondences should be able to push the limit to a new level.Why do we need 3D when 2D is already looking good?People may find some 2D face animations (like the Obama lip sync, Kumar, Rithesh, et al 2017 ) are already quite realistic. Although their results can look good by learning from huge datasets, we are lacking the ability to manipulate these 2D models accurately. Additionally, looking good is not enough, we need to understand what’s really going on. We live in a 3D world, this is what’s really behind every 2D picture and movie frame. So without 3D information, we can’t ask a GAN which is only trained with 2D images and landmarks to maintain the face shape in each frame when it’s rotating. A 3D model also gets more correspondence than 2D for example regarding each pixel’s relevance. Nowadays, face tracking by 2D landmark localization performs pretty well, but landmarks alone can’t provide the dense correspondence between frames. This is the key motivation for making 3D reconstruction more accurate and robust.The paper Learning to Regress 3D Face Shape and Expression from an Image without 3D Supervision is here.About Max Planck Institute for Intelligent SystemsA world leading research institute, the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems has campuses in Stuttgart and Tübingen.

400,7307,https://medium.com/@aloysiuschowhc/7artisans-35mm-f1-2-review-sonnar-on-a-budget-abc10717546b?source=tag_archive---------6-----------------------,7artisans 35mm f1.2 Review: Sonnar on a budget,None,"Aloysius ChowFollow--3ListenShareOverview7artisans has made quite the name for itself as a manufacturer of third party manual focus glass. While its releases have generally been hit or miss, we have seen some very interesting lenses from them, like the 35mm F2 for M-Mount, the upcoming 28mm f1.4 (also M-Mount), and this lens.Let’s get something straight right off the bat: this lens won’t win any awards for sharpness. Or CA. Or contrast, or almost any other technical measure of a lens’s optics for that matter.What this lens is, is a character lens. Featuring an optical design that is based off that of a Sonnar, it delivers rendering and bokeh with characteristics not unlike those of a Jupiter-3 or Zeiss ZM Sonnar (although I wouldn’t say it performs up to the standards of the latter).Build QualityWhile this lens is cheap for its specifications, it feels solid and dense in the hand. A full-metal build and a smooth focus helicoid and aperture ring make using this lens an enjoyable experience. It balances well on the Fujifilm X-E3 I’m using, which was the body used for all the sample photos in this review.The lens comes with a lens cap that slides off if it feels like it. I don’t know why manufacturers still make slip on lens caps in this day and age (I’m looking at you, X100 series). I’ve replaced it with a cheap 43mm lens cap from eBay.I’ve also added the screw on 43mm lens hood from the Fujifilm 35mm f2, and it seems to be a match made in heaven. The hood is just the right size and complements the compactness of the lens perfectly. (I’m using a square hood on the 35mm f2, so I had this hood lying around.)Image QualityThe 35mm f1.2 produces soft images wide open, but one would be foolish to expect more from a lens this small and this fast. Even so, it’s sharp enough to be useful in the centre, and I wouldn’t mind using it wide open if the lighting conditions force me to do so.Surprisingly though, I found it to not be as glowy wide open as some other ultra-fast lenses, like the MS-Optical Sonnetar 50mm f1.1, and it retains contrast quite well at f1.2. Admittedly, that little marvel from Miyazaki covers the full 35mm image circle while this is exclusively an APS-C lens.Here are some… sharpness tests. No charts here so you’ll have to make do with pictures of a camera box.It’s worth noting that when focusing at f1.2, there is a small but noticeable difference in the correct focusing distance when focusing for either contrast or resolution. In the test above, I focused for resolution, but when focusing in real scenarios it’s easier and more intuitive to focus for contrast.There’s a noticeable bump in sharpness going from f1.2 to f1.4 (look at the legibility of the text), and another big step from f2.8 to f4.0 (the texture of the box becomes more apparent).Contrast also improves significantly as you stop down, which is to be expected.BokehWhat would a review of an ultra-fast lens be without some bokeh testing? Generally, I find the out of focus renditions of this lens to be rather pleasing and in line with other lenses of similiar Sonnar formulae.That’s not very exciting though, so here’s a bit of a torture test.From f1.2 to f2.0, you can see that there’s a very distinctive look to the character of the blur in the top left corner, where the light is shining through the leaves. The bokeh balls are outlined, but mainly towards the centre of the image, such that they almost seem like fish scales.I think many would find such rendering distracting. Along the lines of using terms like ‘nervous’ to characterise bokeh, I’d describe the bokeh here as… undergoing a panic attack.It’s worth noting that this is very much a worst-case scenario that exaggerates the character of this lens’s bokeh, and it renders the rest of the frame (namely the bush and other foilage) very smoothly, even though the distinctive one-sided outlining of the bokeh is present.It only becomes an issue when there are many smallish sources of light in close proximity together. When light sources are more sparsely distributed, the ‘fish scale’ effect is hardly as distracting. Furthermore, it’s easy to resolve by stopping down (which you can probably afford to do if you’re shooting a backlit foilage scene). This semi-circular bokeh tones down as you stop the lens down, and full specular highlights are formed from f2.8 onwards.VerdictWhile this lens definitely can’t match the Fuji 35 f2 or f1.4 for technical image quality, it is smaller, cheaper and faster than either of them. And it produces beautiful images with a unique look and (mostly) creamy out of focus renditions.For the price, it’s worth buying even if you already have one of the above Fuji lenses, and it complements my 35mm f2 well despite having the same focal length.You can purchase this lens from Amazon here.I hope this review was of help to you! For more of my work, follow me on Instagram at @warmskies_ or find me on Youtube!SamplesThis lens is very well-suited to portraiture. I don’t have a lot of people to take portraits of, and I have a bit of a thing for cats so… have a ton of cat pictures. (Again, none of them signed release forms. I really hope they don’t read this review.)----3Photographer and writer from SingaporeAloysius Chow--2Aloysius Chow--1Aloysius Chow--Aloysius Chow--1Unbecoming--766Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--418The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--346Alex Mathers--222Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Aloysius Chow,https://medium.com/@aloysiuschowhc,"21, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*xSU7cFcCwF9O8KOSWve2BQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3jL4riJ29awjaKpqLCTc_Q.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*NoRnSKheJ8YcPCpErB4S9Q.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*IR6RZzVoSmp0eKymm6m4tA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-3nqTdmhlwgs5RxHWaMfgg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OzmePHXKI4_1RSY3L9X1gQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FpSjnMfx9QzWcKwfv9MYyw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OE-9XW10qgHOW9WcbPvZNA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*xpuUhJpwAbXGO1W0anpM8Q.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kL_2ouwGnK8bJ-u5oNPbiQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*XDsnIf_jTXNSu7Ia-2K_FA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fS1czXf9vksHD8vldi_RTA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*l3Wcu5ZGraN8jLWiGyGZDg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*-P-a0FBlwpcCzVdmQUHkLA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*OUNUTvVjJfpntIQWZTgiIg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JkDa-9cFMn2thxYC8knxrA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fP9RRIgNCm2NRKVFmfgwlg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*sJMq5O0Ryb4sYOqL_B2VXg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*CLzwHePZwJB8pNf-IoQcnA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EtcsyKZGxPURYoSi0_oCkQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*cpmQ6iLPqIV5lfEUIJ_J_Q.jpeg",6,46

Most of the devices are now connected to the internet at all times. As this network grows, we see more integration of this technology in our day to day lives. IoT is benefitting businesses, homes, hospitals, etc. It also offers crucial benefits which are relevant to the hospitality industry.It can help the hotels to save energy and costs while delivering better customer experiences. It allows the hotel owners to deliver a more personalised experience for their guests and optimise their process. It can result in reduced waiting time and can also help in preventing some problems. IoT can provide various services which can make the whole sector more optimised. Read on!Personalised Hotel RoomsMost of the implications of IoT is heavily centred towards ‘hyper-personalisation’ i.e. providing a personalised experience to every customer. Hotels are providing ‘connected rooms’ which run on IoT. For example, Hilton and Marriott have IoT-enabled rooms which provide more advanced features to the users. They can regulate the temperature, control heating, ventilation, music, air-conditioning and even their TVs with the help of their own smartphones or tablets provided to the users.Streamlined Repairs and MaintenanceWhen all the devices are connected to the internet and provide their status in real-time, there will be fewer chances of operational faults. Staff can get alerts if one of the devices or appliances is not working properly, and can handle the same. It can result in preventing mishaps as repairs and replacement can be done in a timely manner.Electronic Key CardsTraditionally, we use physical RFID cards and even actual keys to unlock doors. But now, after IoT hotels can use this technology to send keys directly to their guests’ mobile phones. This will help them to lock, unlock and eliminate the need for separate keys. Guests can receive their keys one hour before the check-in time and can skip their check-in and go directly to their rooms. Consequently, less wait-time.Voice-controlled Customer ServiceBest Western, Marriott and Wynn are one of the early adopters of voice-controlled customer service. It is an area which will subsequently improve as Amazon Echo devices become widespread. Guests can give commands and ask for services without calling the reception. They can book a room, table at a restaurant and services of spas with their home device.Location-based InformationGPS, Bluetooth and Beacon Technology can help to target users better with their location information and send them relevant messages and texts according to their location. Sending SMS of menu items when the guests are nearby, gym information when they are near the gym, information about local attractions, etc. Although this can get a little annoying so if this becomes reality, you need to be really careful about what you opt for.It is heartening to see the hospitality industry adopting IoT technologies at a rapid pace. Once we get used to the convenience of these technologies in these hotel rooms, it’ll only be a matter of time before we start to see them come home as well. For hotel owners, IoT devices bring a lot of benefits not just in terms of personalisation, but also in terms of bringing costs of maintenance down as well. Ultimately, it is this business sense that will see this rapid adoption accelerate further in this industry.----DeCodeINDeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--1DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",DeCode Staff,https://medium.com/@decodejournal,"5, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*58F-f9SBoEdudVz73jTGvA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*rccnNlsQbtWsvAj8LYWmeg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*_ibCjt_m6sHUJ1Nwh7bTvg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hrpAUkOydMjUwEbbTAPYKA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kDPIAFFoAUvy1Yr6X3H0Qw.png",4,2
404,13812,https://medium.com/@scryptachain/scrypta-polls-system-blockchain-platform-for-electronic-voting-c126e0c1f5b8?source=tag_archive---------141-----------------------,Scrypta Polls System — Blockchain platform for electronic voting,None,"ScryptaFollow--ListenShareBy studying the feasible implementation of the blockchain in online voting, the Scrypta development team has experienced how this technology could solve the fundamental problems related to privacy, transparency and security. The “Scrypta Polls System” arised from this study.The Minimal Viable Product is functional and operational.“We have created a dApp, based on blockchain technology, which could make the voting system safer and more transparent”.Thanks to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, the fairness of the vote can be verified by all the participants in the network. Voting data is not stored on servers but in blocks of information recorderd on all of the Scrypta network nodes computers. To pollute them, a hacker would need to penetrate all computers and gain access to individual nodes (data sets).During the ongoing experimentation we tested this kind of pollution to show that it was possible to vote and track who voted, but it was not possible to connect individual votes to a specific voter. All this by exploiting a permissionless blockchain whose block explorer is visible and can be inspected by anyone who wants to.The platform was implemented with a fundamental element: the dispatch of the “form” anonymously as well as the univocal registration of the users.We proceeded as follows:The promoter, which we will call “owner”, creates a new address for voting.At this point it will be executed a transaction with the data to initialize the vote. Below is an example of the object that is stored:pollData = {name: ‘VOTE NAME’,pubkey: ‘VOTE PUBKEY’,privkey: ‘VOTE PRIVKEY’,owner: ‘OWNER PUBLIC ADDRESS’,start_date: ‘START DATE’,start_time: ‘START TIME’,end_date: ‘END DATE’,end_time: ‘END TIME’,question: ‘VOTE QUESTION’,answers: ‘ANSWES ARRAY’};As you can see public data related to voting is required, including the private key of the same address. This for a purely demonstrative purpose and for the will to create a truly serverless system. Alternatively the private key would reside in the owner’s device.As we will see later, although this private key is visible, the system is totally secure. You will see a sample transaction at this address: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx.dws?262865.htm.This is the first of a series of transactions that refer to the same block 124565 https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/block.dws?124565.htm.Once the vote will be initialized and then waited for the network to process the data block (1 minute on average), our vote will be available on the platform. From this moment on, users can request authorization to participate in the vote.So, let’s imagine an intermediate period between the creation of the “Poll” and the actual start of the vote in which all users will request to be accepted.In this case, what happens in the background is the user sending a transaction to the voting address, using the poll: // AUTHREQUEST protocolA transaction of this kind can be analyzed at this address: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx.dws?262891.htm.Off-chain — the system also stores the user’s RSA public key (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) which will be used when issuing the ballot paper.At this point the voting owner will have the burden of authorizing or not authorizing the addresses of the applicants.In the case of public voting, the owner will only issue an authorization if, for example, the identity of the applicant is physically demonstrated (perhaps through a KYC document or practice). Or it could be online, if the user will demontrate (off-chain) his identity, for example by sending an OTP to a certified mailbox. In other cases, common biometrics techniques could be implemented such as fingerprint scanning, etc …When the voting owner authorizes a user to vote he will publicly send two different transactions: One to the polling address, using the poll: // AUTH protocol, so as to write publicly that the address has been authorized.The second transaction is the result of following steps:• Creation of a new address (public and private key pair)• Address encryption using the user’s RSA public key• Result registration by the voting address• Sending the necessary funds to the voting transaction (0.002 LYRA in this case), which is carried out by the owner at the address of the ballot paper.From this moment on, specific traces between the user and the voting form are lost. Below we refer to the example links that demonstrate the two operations:• transaction for sending a voting form: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx.dws?262942.htm• sending of funds by the owner to the voting form: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx.dws?262930.htmAs you can see, the poll: // VOTECARD protocol was used to identify the rating cards. There is effectively no link between the voter’s address and the address of his ballot paper, as different technologies are used which, although supported, cannot be linked in any way.He will therefore be the only user to be able to verify his own “card” within the voting transactions. This system can:• index users;• authorize them on a single basis;• entrust him with a unique and totally disconnected identity card (unlockable only by the user).At this point the user will have to wait for his ballot paper to be issued and, as soon as it will be available, vote with it. If we go back to the same example transaction, we will see that it was used in this other operation: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx.dws?263000.htm.Here it can be clearly seen that the protocol used is poll: // VOTE: 0 which clearly identifies the user’s choice. Going to retrace the input of this transaction, we will see that they refer to this address: “LctPjsVtdmoQXBonWPTJv6DfvjH2Vyvwzy” which is the voting owner, as can be clearly seen from the first transaction: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/lyra/tx .dws?262868.htm.Now we don’t have any more doubt, this vote was certainly authorized by the owner, as it was the owner himself who generated this ballot.The user is also entitled to verify that his vote has been counted correctly, retracing the same procedure in reverse:• The address is scanned by the user.• The user decrypts the ballot papers.• As soon as the voting form is found, the incoming transaction is searched for with the poll: // VOTE protocol:The user will finally have found and verified the correct acquisition of his vote.Each user can also scan all incoming transactions and count the votes in real time, verifying the actual validity of the same.“It seems we were able apply the expression ‘Don’t trust, verify’ to the thorny use case of the voting system. Clearly this is just an MVP that could not be used (at present) as a national and public voting system. We hope that our work will help those in government who are looking for solutions “.The MVP source code is publicly available on Github at the following link:https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-pollsWe invite and allow blockchain enthusiasts, testers or e-voting supporters to verify and examine the technology behind our solution.----Adaptive BlockchainScrypta--Scrypta--1Scrypta--Scrypta--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Scrypta,https://medium.com/,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VcAK6WpNkO3qEmUIRWonvQ.png",6,71

As technology becomes more and more integrated into our everyday lives, people, especially the younger generation, are getting progressively more dependent on technology. According to market research firm Childwise, “Children aged 5 to 16 spend an average of six and a half hours a day in front of a screen compared with around three hours in 1995”. This dramatic increase in the amount of time that the younger generation spends on technology is a result of them being surrounded by advance technology from the moment they’re born, the technology allows them to have access to a whole network of communications, all in the palm of their hands. However, this increase in the time spent on technology decreases the amount of time that children spend on other activities that help them learn and develop socially.As technology becomes increasingly widespread, the availability of technology to young children and toddlers is also increasing, as they have unprecedented access to screen media. Some parents are even allowing their toddlers to watch television or play on their mobile devices for long periods of time. However, the amount of screen time given to a toddler or a young kid should be limited, because although technology does provide many positive benefits for learning and creativity, it also causes many negative effects on a young child’s development and quality of life.Technology changes how young children socialize and interact with other people. A major concern that doctors have is that the social interactions that kids need with others are decreasing as a result of our digital age. Psychologist Dr. Aric Sigman said that children are watching more screen media than ever, research shows that on any given day, 64% of babies between one and two watch TV and videos for an average of slightly over 2 hours and the time that preschoolers spend on average with screen media ranges from at least 2.2 hours to as much as 4.6 hours per day. Sigman calculates that children born in the 21st century will have spent a full year glued to screens by the time they reach the age of seven. This excess use of technology lowers a child’s real-time social interactions. The time that they spend on technology and screens could be spent interacting with others and developing socially. According to nonprofit organization CCFC, “ Developing children thrive when they are talked to, read to, played with, and given time for creative play, active play, and interactions with other children and adults”. However, sitting in front of a television for hours prevents that child from having the hours of developmental experiences that they need. The child would have more difficulty in developing meaningful relationships with others-something that can have negative consequences as they grow and develop. They will also have a difficult time developing emotions the same way other kids would if they spend too much of their time with technology and not enough time being engaged while in the presence of others.Some parents, however, may argue that kids should be exposed to both technology and the internet at an early age as it’s such a large part of our everyday lives. The National Association for the Education of Young Children also claims that “technology provides lots of opportunities for learning especially since digital technology allows for an outlet in which the toddlers can demonstrate their creativity and learning”. However, although technology provides a creative outlet for young children, it doesn’t provide children with the crucial emotional, social, cognitive, or physical experiences they require when they are young.Parents should also time monitor and regulate the time that their kids spend on technology so that the child won’t become “addicted” to technology and screens, especially as technology becomes increasingly prevalent in today’s society. Regulating technology use will allow the child to not be on technology as much, providing them more opportunities to learn how to develop meaningful relationships with others. One way that parents could prevent too much technology use of their kid is to set a good example when they’re growing up. In our modern era, digital technologies have become a necessity for older children and adults. So often times in order to decrease your child’s reliance on technology, first you as a parent need to set a good example. If your kid sees you on your phone or computer constantly, they will grow up thinking that constantly being on technology is okay and will want to use technology all the time which will not help your child develop socially as they grow.Works Cited“Effective Classroom Practice: Preschoolers and Kindergarteners.” National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2019, www.naeyc.org/resources/topics/technology-and-media/preschoolers-and-kindergartners.

Now you can easily experience visual search using your own set of images.pixolution flow is our AI-powered visual search engine for enterprises. You can license it for integration into your app.After signing up for your trial, you have an empty collection. Just upload local images and experience visual search or duplicate detection within your image collection. For more in-depth testing of visual search, duplicate detection, and also image tagging please upload a file containing your image URLs and metadata. While importing the data you can start testing right away — even if the indexing process is still ongoing.Of course, the more data you import, the better the search results can be. Enjoy testing our great features!With the visual search features you can search for certain images in your collection. There are several options to start a search: You can just click the Find similar button of an image, type in a keyword, choose a color or use an external image as search input to search for similar ones in your collection.A combination of keywords and visual search criteria is also supported.Detect duplicate visual content without using metadata. Upload an external image or paste an image URL. The pixels are analyzed to detect image duplicates with different sizes, file names, file formats, encoding quality, or visual modifications. A slider lets you determine the detection sensitivity to fit your needs.Upload an external image or paste an image URL and get keywords for that image. Keyword suggestions are generated based on your previously imported keyword data. Those keywords act as the ground truth. If there is no or not sufficient data, suggestions cannot be made.The big advantages of this approach: suggestions are always made in your language, and if you have a controlled vocabulary it is taken into account since only previously indexed keywords will be suggested. The wording style is consistent throughout your complete image collection and therefore fragmented results through different wording is avoided.Bringing visual search to end-user is not only a question of technology, but also of the user interface. Everybody understands to type keywords in a searchbar. We’ve implemented a searchbar that retains the known search paradigma but at the same time supports colors and images as search input.This is the result of three iterations with customer feedback and demonstrate how visual search should be integrated into a search app. The searchbar is very powerful and handles different input types but hides the complexity of handling them. Simplicity is the best way to increase user adoption.Just test it yourself. If handling visual input types feels as natural as handling text, then we did it right.You would also like to test the features via API? We will provide API access in the near future. You will then be able to integrate visual search in your own project.Sign up for your free trialOriginally published at pixolution.org/blog.----Visual Search AI.

It was a very proud moment for us that we had completed one year successfully and were ready to welcome the new batch with open arms.The session started with me, introducing the core team and taking a brief introduction of the attendees. After the introduction, it was amazing to know that the new batch is much more talented than we were at our times. Some of them even know what Android Development is or Machine Learning is; even some of them are smart to take up their engineering fields keeping in mind the future job scopes. So kudos to them! In our times, even the terms “Android Development” or “Machine Learning” were alien to us and for some of us, the reason behind taking up computer science was because we were not good at any subject other than this(;D).After the introduction session, I shared with the attendees the story of the formation of DSC TIU and its short but sweet journey till date. Then came the most important part of this session — introducing the attendees to the various tracks of DSC TIU and other well-known technologies(like Google Cloud). First, we shared what Action on Google is, gave them one short demo using one action and showing them the cool T-shirt which one will be getting on the successful launch of his/her first action and the Google cloud credits as well(the T-shirt definitely made them excited about AOG :D).Due to the time limit, it was not possible to show both Android and Flutter projects, so the participants were shown only one Flutter project — this project was made as a solution to a local problem. This application lets the user book a photographer for any occasion with all the specifications needed thus making the booking process completely digital.Then the attendees were given a very short break and meanwhile, a quiz session was taken; on giving a correct answer, the attendee was given a band which I got from the gala night during the DSC India Summit and for the ones who didn’t win, we had our DSC stickers for them.Then we had an introduction to Machine Learning — the participants were explained what neural network, what Tensorflow is, and then shown a demonstration on controlling packman with one’s hand using a webcam. The participants were also shown a project where a baby’s weight is predicted taking into account the mother’s weight and the gestation week.At last, the participants were given an introduction to Web Development — a brief discussion on PHP, Ruby, Angular and JS, and the power of Progressive Web Apps ie PWA(ps- try Air Horner once, this definitely made the session a lot of fun :D).The session ended with cake-cutting to as a belated celebration of DSC TIU’s birthday and to welcome the new batch as well and we were lucky to have our respected Prof. Ishan Ghosh with us to join this celebration.That’s all for today…see you next time.Signing off,Atri DasStudent LeadDSC Techno India Universitywww.facebook.comsites.google.com----Developer Student Clubs train thousands of student developers globally and work with their communities to solve real-life problems.Developer Student Clubs TIU--Developer Student Clubs TIU--Developer Student Clubs TIU--Developer Student Clubs TIU--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alex Mathers--227Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Developer Student Clubs TIU,https://medium.com/@dsctechnoindiauniversity,"10, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*GnB9THCUjOVAKb7eoFaVFA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*_EpXpOlqQt0zoq6VICqOZw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*9MixfdTyGZb6dRHSLJj9bg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*MvFeNoA3yR9Od9RHa_ATgA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Ua1i6LSTaPVCIyf894ktdw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*X5hXn8aq5jYImnOV4IWFvg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JV5r2oMyDxBrmohVlQWFPA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mK_1btCTaQFNclcfV7P6jQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*gKY9nm-iQ7ufMGOqeOJ4Eg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*vIrpoJ1hgImOHEEClvcYog.jpeg",4,444

(一)｜Dino.LJYang,Smartscooter、GoShare、Gogoro Network全面打造 AIoT 智慧城，Gogoro Network骨子裡還賣什麼 ?,"Dino. LJYangFollow--Share如果你曾經觀望、想要購買 Gogoro系列車款，卻始終拿不定主意，可能是因為較為高額的費用，或對於電池交換使用模式有所疑慮，GoShare 可能是幫助你試乘的好方法。GoShare 是由睿能創意主持的機車共享平台，透過手機 App 可以快速找到就近有電的可用Gogogro。這個月21號，GoShare 以 Gogoro 最新車款 VIVA 因應台北狹小的停車環境，展開運營。如果目標是所以白牌車款，GoShare 已早在 8 月於桃園開放使用。「以租代買」必定存在巨大的商業利潤與誘因。對於台北，Gogoro 這項新服務確實引發了熱議與試乘的人潮，但其實機車共享已不是新鮮事，和運體系的 iRent 與 新創威摩的 Wemo 都已搶先一步站穩台北市場，今年更轉向台台與高雄拓點。「共享」一詞一直在趨勢浪尖上，從 Uber的乘車共享、車站書櫃的閱讀共享，機車的共享機制顯而易見，但你是否有想過 :相較於 iRent 與 Wemo 專為共享業務而生的企業，「Gogoro 主要是賣車又賣電，為何想要參上共享業務一腳呢 ? 」從一間企業的產品開發脈絡，我們可以推敲出它的商業策略與護城河的真實性，首先我們來細數Gogoro手上有多少武器 :1. 電動機車 :Gogoro 起家之際，本來僅想做電源管理系統，但對於初期欲合作目標的機車廠，因不穩定的供電系統與長期習慣的油車生產鏈已穩定賺錢，而拒 Gogoro 於門外。為了讓自家電源產品有穩定的使用載體，才開展了電動車的自產線，奠定了Gogoro 現在綠能電車龍頭的形象。2. GoStationSwap and Go，我念作「抽換便走」，Gogoro 機車的標準補電方法。Gogoro 因應使用者不希望機車充電的過度等待，加上電池本身稍有些重量，便設計了現階段滑順的抽換模式。想想看生活中，「火鍋料自己放」就像吃「健康鍋」，蛋糕店一站式提供烤具與原料給你DIY，就吸引大量人潮。特殊少見的 DIY 換電體驗，強化了消費者「身體力行的環保概念」，「Swap and Go」更被設計成時尚的口號，引領大眾對新一代環保電車的第一印象。GoStation 換電站就是此創舉的延伸產品，搭配後端的 AI 分析與雲服務分配用電需求，將其視為台灣第一代無人商店也不為過。3. Gogoro Network我們常在說資源分配不均，像是金錢、教育，最大的問題就是欠缺一份促進移動的載體，能源、電力亦同。此時Gogoro機車成了攜電的載體，載著餘電前往各地交換站，有效、且適性的備載電力。交換頻率變得頻繁，代表此電源系統更加健康，當高效的計算與調度足以供給自身以外的車電系統時，Gogoro Network 儼然而生。那回過頭來看，為什麼普遍機車共享都是以電動車為主 ?生物學有一詞「趨同演化」，便是強調來自不同分類的的生物物種，在特定環境裡為了適應與生存，會不約而同地產生相似器官與特徵，就像「魚類」與「鯨豚」。就結果看來，Gogoro 從能源管理到共享機車是碰巧，同時是有跡可循了的。1. 性能監控需求共享機車業務若要長久經營則無法倚賴消費者有自覺的使用行為，為防止惡意末壞偷竊，或維繫機體基本運轉品質，經營企業必定監控機車使用情況與機身性能。正好這都是電動車場的主流 App 可以做到的，雙向回報行車定位、胎壓電量等性能監控、數位開通使用權。2. 消費行為需求目前共享機車能源見底，運營商主要有兩種處理方法:一來工作人員個別手動換電，二來請消費者自行換電。可以如此操作不外乎充電電池方便攜帶移動、更換快速不拖時，換做使用油車運營共享服務，駕駛自行進加油站充油或工作人員駕駛大車個別加油都相對不便。在這我們先稍微提一下「現代感」，很多讀者都知道 Gogoro 自詡為能源供應商，但隨著消費者心占率提升與節能、智能政策的強化，從 Gogoro 的種種措施看得出來他們量一個目標是與能源系統一樣高為格局的「智慧城市」。初步的 Smarty City 智慧城市裡已含有相當多「早期想像中的現代感城市」的特徵與要素，用環保綠電、一隻手機能搞定的 IoT 連網服務、一台懂你並立刻回應你的移動載具「Smartscooter® 智慧雙輪」。這已是Gogoro 熟悉的業務項目，我視為「科技『服務』人類行為」。但在更進一步的 Smarty City ，開始強調智慧城市本身的自體活化，進入城市本身整合各種資訊進行有效的資源分配與管理，例如尖峰車流經計算後透過人力或紅利燈號來調度與管理、自行監測開啟與關閉不必要電源消耗設備。GoStation 便是以用電優惠、路徑選擇來改變行人的目的地，回饋數據所期待的最佳道路使用狀態，這我看作是「科技『改變且優化』人類行為」。不過除了這些根本性的顛覆系統，Gogoro 也強調單一機車的現在元素。聽創始團隊的 設計總監王崧富 就能看到設計上舒適的圓滑觸感與多位使用者著想的功能都是Gogoro想傳透過機車傳達的現代感的「Friendly」。下一篇將提到關於Gogoro的 :- 台灣的電動車元年與企業結盟- PBGN (Powered by Gogoro Network™ )- 主題(二) https://lihi1.cc/gOdHL- 主題(三) https://lihi1.cc/UPFlq----Messy Cool-Stuff included Digital Marketing, ECommerce, Business Development.

413,55233,https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/the-journey-to-fox-token-2fc787fef505?source=tag_archive---------18-----------------------,The Journey to FOX Token,Learn about the perpetual nature of ,"ShapeShiftFollowShapeShift Stories--1ListenShareThe following is a note from our Chief Operating Officer Jon — at the launch of ShapeShift’s zero-commission trading strategy which leverages the FOX token.As the world watched the ICO boom of 2017 and the proliferation of some interesting and many non-interesting tokens, many folks sat up and took notice. What people noticed the most were the huge price swings, the vast sums of money raised through these tokens long before anything was actually built, the proliferation of the words “token” and “blockchain” permeating throughout society, and a lot of warranted skepticism. Though, some of us, especially at ShapeShift, noticed something else. It wasn’t just the trading volumes, speculative price appreciation, and new fundraising model that was so interesting. What was far more interesting was what this Cambrian explosion of tokens made possible.Since the birth of Bitcoin, the world has been watching a new asset class start to crawl and walk (we aren’t running just yet). Bitcoin grew from nothing to show the world that the mechanism behind how blockchain consensus works is pragmatically valuable and technically sound. What we thought was that a new type of money — and eventually a store of value — could exist electronically, powered entirely by sophisticated technology and the earned belief of its users. This exposed some of the magic underpinnings of how “money” and financial “value” works for many to see, who did not fully realize yet. But this wasn’t just a new type of money. It was a new asset class that broke many previously held definitions.Sign up to trade for free with FOX in the ShapeShift Platform 🚀As Bitcoin continued to mature, we saw the token explosion of 2017. For those who were paying attention, this was the continuing evolution of that magic spark that bitcoin lit. The explosion exposed the further magic (not just the underpinnings) of what we call “money” and demonstrated that this technology could allow for the creation of a plethora of entirely new, category-breaking assets called “tokens”.That token explosion of 2017 created a snowball, rolling downhill towards the creation of previously impossible asset types and entirely new business engagement models. We’ve only scratched the surface of what is possible; with each development, the snowball has grown a little larger. In the vast scale of things, it’s still pretty small. There’s much more ahead to explore as it tumbles forward and gains further mass.At ShapeShift, we started exploring some of these concepts in our very early days. Since 2014 we’ve maintained our thesis and philosophy that there would be many different, interesting blockchain assets in addition to Bitcoin and the world needed an easy way to convert from one to another. This thesis drove us to create the original ShapeShift conversion service. In 2016 we started exploring the idea internally of a ShapeShift token that would allow us to further explore the crypto frontier in ways impossible pre-token. The momentum of 2017 was a validation of this thesis, despite the excesses and misguided projects that came and went.We watched and we waited, and through many internal discussions our potential token took many forms, culminating in what we are distributing to the world for the first time today: FOX token.The FOX token is ShapeShift’s biggest leap into the frontier since the original creation of our service, though this will not be obvious immediately. We intend to push the limits of what is possible and what the world has come to understand regarding blockchain tokens. At its genesis, FOX will act in some ways like a loyalty token. Earn FOX by interacting with ShapeShift by actively trading (and other promotions over time). The more FOX accumulated the more benefits endowed to the users who hold them.Loyalty tokens and programs are not a new concept, they exist all over the world in different forms: airline miles, cash back on a credit card, points at the supermarket or your favorite restaurant — and they, of course, exist in many forms already in the crypto world.medium.comWhat is new, however, is the way tokens let us approach the concept of a loyalty-based program. In particular, the FOX token will be one of the world’s first loyalty tokens that is a perpetual asset. What we mean by that is that unlike the vast majority of utility tokens currently out there, FOX will not require you to consume or spend it in order to receive its value. You get value simply by holding the asset. Starting at launch, this value is $10 of zero-commission trading per FOX every 30 days, and every user who joins our platform starts with 100 free FOX. This is not some nominal promotional value, this is perpetual and important value that the FOX holder receives; the ability to continually trade for free every month. This value does not disappear after using it, free trading replenishes on a rolling 30 day basis simply by continuing to hold FOX. It will do so as long as you hold FOX or until you transfer it somewhere else outside of your ShapeShift Platform account.medium.comWe think this perpetual nature of FOX is one of the key pieces that allows us to push the token frontier forward and explore yet another category-breaking asset class, that the world hasn’t quite seen before. FOX as a digital perpetual asset is not just a loyalty program, it’s not just a membership, it’s not just an exchange token, it’s all of these things, none of these things, and it sets a basic foundation for customer engagement that will evolve alongside our company.One of the magic pieces of tokens is that they can take on a life of their own. All of their utility and use cases are not just determined by the creator and issuer, but by the community that forms around them and directly engages with them. Imagine if your Amazon Prime membership was a token that you could sell off to another person when you no longer wanted it, or airline miles were far easier to transfer among a marketplace, or a Costco membership that didn’t need to be renewed every year — but had perpetual value if you acquired it and could be traded among your friends. These are the types of use cases and situations that the advent of perpetual tokens makes possible.In some ways, the difference between consumable and perpetual assets can be thought of in the context of renting or buying an apartment. When you are renting, you get the use of the place as long as you pay for it every month. At the end of your lease, the apartment goes back to its owner and you don’t get any of your money back. If you buy an apartment instead, it’s yours and you get the benefit of living there. If you don’t want to live there anymore, you can sell it to someone else who wants to buy it (or even rent it to someone if you want to keep it). The apartment may have gone up or down in value, but it’s yours and you get some value back by selling it.The majority of tokens that have been seen in the blockchain world allow for some new way to explore this rent concept, like buying a token to get lower exchange fees (but you pay upfront and then it's gone). With FOX and the evolution of perpetual tokens, we allow for something much closer to really buying and owning something. When you own FOX, you truly own it and it does not need to be burned, consumed, or sacrificed to receive value from it.Many current models can be changed or looked at differently though this perpetual lense and it can be a push away from “rent-seeking” behavior, towards more experimentation with “ownership-seeking” behavior. This use case can be extended to many places and a single asset can end up having many uses. The important facet is that a new frontier of interesting perpetual utility assets can be opened up and explored. Bitcoin planted this seed, and we are further exploring one little branch of it. Our intention is for the FOX token to further demonstrate what’s possible.We envision a whole world and a plethora of new tokens with perpetual natures and varied use cases. We think FOX can be one of the first examples given to the world of a perpetual utility token that can represent these various use cases. It doesn’t require an ICO, or speculative fervor or anything like that to create value. Instead, its value comes from the attributes it can endow its user simply by holding it (almost like a magical sword in a video game where you can upgrade and stack the powers it gives you). In my view, this is a form of magic and a type of magic the world will find endlessly fascinating.With the creation and distribution of the FOX token, we peel back and expose a little more of the underlying magic of tokenized value creation. Perhaps this concept will resonate in the minds of other entrepreneurs, creators, and communities, highlighting what is possible in the evolution of new digital assets and tokens.>>> Sign up to receive 100 FOX tokens and try free trading. <<<Join our new Telegram channel.

Both differed in every point about AI, but the only thing to which both agreed was that a population collapse is more likely to happen in coming 20 years.Let us discuss some important points of this interesting debate :“The biggest mistake I see people making is to assume they’re smart,” Musk countered. AI will be “much smarter than the smartest human you will ever know.”Ma likened the view that humans won’t be able to compete with their machine inventions in most aspects of life — Musk’s stance — to people of a century ago trying to out-run cars they manufacture. “I never in my life say human beings will be controlled by machines, it’s impossible,” said Ma.“Computers may be clever, but human beings are much smarter,” Ma said. “We invented the computer — I’ve never seen a computer invent a human being.”Ma proclaimed that people should be able to in-fact work 12-hour weeks, a seeming reversal of comments just months prior that it’s a privilege to work “996,” or nine to nine, six days a week.But humanity will also have more leisure time in the future as AI takes on much of the burden of transporting, feeding, and thinking for earthlings, said Ma.“People could work as little as three days a week, four hours a day with the help of technology advances,” he said.Furthermore, he predicted AI would help create new kind of jobs, which would require less of our time and be centered on creative tasks.By contrast, Mr Musk suggested that mass unemployment was a real concern. “AI will make jobs kind of pointless,” he claimed.“Probably the last job that will remain will be writing AI, and then eventually, the AI will just write its own software.” Musk added.The Chinese entrepreneur said he was “quite optimistic” about AI and thought it was nothing for “street smart” people like them to be scared of.“I don’t know man, that’s like famous last words,” responded Tesla’s chief.Mr Musk added that technology was evolving faster than our ability to understand it.Mr Ma accepted that AI could now beat humans at games like chess and Go, but claimed computers would only be one of several intelligent tools that we would develop in time.“Don’t worry about the machines,” he said.“For sure, we should understand one thing: that man can never make another man. A computer is a computer. A computer is just a toy.” He added.“Man cannot even make a mosquito. So, we should have a confidence. Computers only have chips, men have the heart. It’s the heart where the wisdom comes from.”Although Mr Ma acknowledged that we needed to find ways to become “more creative and constructive”, he concluded that “my view is that [a] computer may be clever, but human beings are much smarter”.Mr Musk responded: “Yeah, definitely not.”“It’s going to get to the point where [AI] just can completely simulate a person in every way possible, like many people simultaneously,” he added.“In fact, there’s a strong argument, we’re in the simulation right now.”Towards the end of the event the two men came together on one point — that concerns about overpopulation were misguided.“Assuming… there’s a benevolent future with AI, I think that the biggest problem the world will face in 20 years is population collapse,” said Mr Musk“I want to emphasize this, the biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse, not explosion collapse.”Mr Ma said he was absolutely in agreement.“One point four billion in China sounds a lot, but I think [over the] next 20 years we’ll see this thing bring big trouble to China,” he said.“And the speed of population decreasing is going to speed up. Now you’ve got a collapse.”Ma and Musk — differed in their perspective of the future of AI but both were sure that human mortality is a good thing as each generation brings new ideas to the global challenges we face.How do you see AI ?How it is going to change our lives?Let me know in the comments.

In fact, AI in health care is redefining the medical care field and all its functions.It is playing a big role in health care data. When health care data uses AI, it provides new and improved analytics. AI analytics are of use in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. AI in health care is helping to provide more targeted care for patients fighting medical diseases or issues.AI in health care is even working on a 3D holographic representations of a patient’s anatomy. This is of use for patients who are not able to be present themselves for the doctor. This type of AI technology in health care records everything from the patient’s physiological data to their medical images. It allows for a much more accurate diagnosis.The obvious benefit of AI in health care is accuracy. There is no risk of human error. This will allow for breaking down a patient’s medical need by joining it to analytic data for treatment options.There are different types of AI technologies that help patient outcomes when used in health care. However, most people don’t realize how much AI is currently in their health care. Below are the different types of AI functions in health care:Today, in the health care field there are AI robot prototypes performing health care tasks. AI allows humanoid robots to figure out what is being said. AI is allowing the humanoid robot to also respond.This is allowing for the use of AI humanoid robots in various health care markets:The future of AI in health care has nowhere to go but up. We are an aging population, and many of our geriatric disorders will be using AI research. This AI research will help provide treatments this population needs. AI in health care will conduct ongoing research and analyze data. It will also assess testing results and administer diagnoses.That’s not including the future of AI in pharmaceutical companies. AI will provide better research and testing for pharmaceutical companies. It will tweak drug discovery and fine-tune drug purposes. The future of AI will teach medical classes and provide health care training.The future of AI will give simulated experiences for participants. It will have the ability to meet ongoing or new medical challenges by adjusting its data program.It will also allow for training by anyone who wants health care classes no matter where they live in the world. It will not matter whether they live in Antartica or on the space station.The digital universe now has a permanent new family member with AI. What we need to ask ourselves now are some relevant questions. Given that artificial intelligence in health care grows every day. Should we be exploring some hard questions about its use?Should artificial intelligence’s use within the health care field have man-made limitations? How about HIPAA compliance? What are the ethical considerations? It is likely that these questions and others will need to be answered before there is industry-wide adoption.----AI.ioTerence MillsinAI.io--Terence MillsinAI.io--Terence MillsinAI.io--Terence MillsinAI.io--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Terence Mills,https://medium.com/@terence_mills,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*6EOyRo6oarCOYSvsH5FQnw.png",4,20

This move represents a massive leap forward in the banking industry’s thinking around APIs and ecosystems.As I’ve written before, the banking industry’s reactions to digital disruption have been at best inconsistent, with incumbents often unwilling to challenge the status quo and to make the changes necessary to compete with digital natives. As a standard that any business can leverage, SWIFT’s “Pay Later” API specification is well positioned to pull the financial industry in new directions and help businesses launch services that better support customers’ buying preferences.Over the last couple years, we have seen application programming interfaces (APIs) foisted upon banks via regulatory mandates. Open Banking regulations such as Europe’s PSD2, for example, require that when customers consent, banks must make payment initiation and account transaction data accessible to third parties via APIs. This effectively enables start-ups, fintechs, and challenger banks to muscle into payment services over which banks have traditionally held tight control. These laws have been written with consumers in mind and are intended to increase competition in banking. Consequently, some banking leaders view the API economy as detrimental to their business.However, the competitive landscape has changed massively over the last decade.Virtually every industry is increasingly dominated by software platforms and the ecosystems that surround them. Amazon, Etsy, Uber, Lyft, Square, Airbnb — more and more, the channels that consumers use to transact value and secure services rely on interactions facilitated by software. These platforms have spent many years and many millions — and often, billions — of dollars building out their ecosystems. As consumers and businesses increasingly transact on these platforms, bank executives should ask how they can ensure they have access to these customers.This is the promise of the SWIFT “Pay Later” API announcement. APIs are the way software talks to other software — and they are thus the way enterprises embed their core business functions into digital platforms and ecosystems. Nothing is more core to banking than lending and payments. With this announcement, SWIFT is helping to define the industry’s response to the growing dominance of these platforms and the threat of disruption from alternative payments fintechs that are already executing API strategies to capture lending business during the purchase transaction.In designing the API specification, SWIFT assembled stakeholders along the entire value chain to ensure that its approach would work for merchants, banks, and the underlying technology systems that power them. It also recognized the inherent mismatch among increasingly global platforms and today’s highly-fragmented banking industry. Only by working together and showing willingness to self-disrupt can banks hope to compete with the rising flood of fintechs.It is thrilling to see the announcement of the “Pay Later” API specification. It is not only recognition by the banking industry that the competitive landscape has changed, but also a positive move by banks to come together to proactively compete in the API economy. The question now is, will banks work together and utilize APIs to preserve their role in commerce?*SWIFT is a customer of my employer, Google Cloud’s Apigee team. SWIFT’s announcement is distinct from its work with Apigee.[Interested in tips for building a storefront for your API products?

En lugar de esperar que las personas de datos puedan hacerlo todo, comencemos a preguntarnos unos a otros: “¿De qué tipo eres tú?”. Y más importante aún, es hora de que nos hagamos la misma pregunta a nosotros mismos.Trabajar en una parte del universo de datos no requiere automáticamente que seamos expertos en todo.Advertencia: Hice estas caricaturas para ayudarte a comenzar a tener un mapa mental, pero todos sabemos que la vida real no siempre colorea perfectamente dentro de las líneas de límite. Por ejemplo, una persona puede usar varios sombreros, o las fases del proyecto pueden sobreponerse, por una iteración no planificada. Por favor no me arrojes tomates por falta de colores.ML / IA aplicado en el mundo real (ML= Machine Learning; IA = Inteligencia Artificial) reúne todas las laborales relacionadas con las funciones de datos, desde estadísticos hasta ingenieros de confiabilidad. Incluso si has estudiado *todos* los cursos de datos (sí, claro), no hay suficientes horas en el día para que una persona haga todo solo, así que hagamos un safari rápido de roles comunes en el ecosistema de ciencia de datos, explicado con una analogía de la cocina.No hay suficientes horas en el día para que una persona haga todo solo.Si explicaras tu trabajo usando términos con los que tus amigos de la industria alimentaria se sintieran como en casa, ¿cuál de estos sería el que aplicaría mejor? (Mi artículo original de analogía de cocina está aquí).Ingeniería de datos: fuentes e ingredientes del proceso. Esto viene en dos sabores: (1) proporcionar conjuntos de datos para que los científicos de datos los usen y (2) permitir la entrega de datos a escala.La compra de comestibles es fácil sólo si estás cocinando algo para tu propia cena, pero cuando aumenta la escala, lo trivial se vuelve complejo: ¿cómo adquieres, almacenas y procesas 20 toneladas de helado… sin dejar que nada se derrita? La escala lo convierte en un desafío sofisticado. Del mismo modo, la ingeniería de datos es bastante fácil cuando descargas una pequeña hoja de cálculo para tu proyecto escolar, pero aturde cuando manejas datos a escala de petabytes.Investigación en ciencia de datos: inventa nuevos tipos de electrodomésticos de cocina. Puedes pensar en esto como el lado de la investigación teórica de la ciencia de datos, y es para lo que te prepara un doctorado en ML / IA / Estadísticas / Optimización. Se trata de crear una teoría para expandir los tipos de problemas que la humanidad puede resolver.Los investigadores inventan cosas nuevas. Lo emocionante de su carrera es demostrar que lo que antes era imposible es posible. Tienden a disfrutar hasta el prototipado del trabajo, y luego están persiguiendo el próximo desafío. En términos de la analogía de la cocina, se trata de los planos de los electrodomésticos. Quizás conviertan esos planos en un dispositivo que haga el trabajo, pero esperan que los electrodomésticos se mantengan unidos por esperanza y cinta adhesiva… cierran la puerta y se desmoronan. En cuanto a la interfaz, claro, esa secuencia de botones tenía sentido en la cabeza del investigador, pero si intentas usarla te arrancarás el pelo de la frustración. ¿Fácil de usar? ¿Robusto? ¿Bien diseñado? ¡Olvídalo! Ese es el trabajo de otra persona. Tus investigadores están demasiado ocupados descubriendo cómo llevar las capacidades de teletransportación al microondas. (¿Cuándo contratar a un investigador para tu equipo de trabajo? Cuando sabes que necesitas capacidades de teletransportación y nadie ha inventado la teletransportación todavía).Fabricación de herramientas de datos / Ingeniería de plataformas: construye dispositivos fáciles de usar en cómodas cocinas. Se trata de proporcionar herramientas y plataformas bellamente diseñadas para que científicos de datos las usen.Los investigadores no suelen fabricar el microondas que realmente tú disfrutarás usando. Es ahí es donde entran los ingenieros de plataforma. Estas personas no inventan nuevos tipos de diagramas de cableado o planos, sino que hacen que los existentes estén disponibles para consumo masivo. El equipo que realiza esta parte del trabajo se reúne para estudiar detalladamente el diseño, la confiabilidad y la eficiencia. Hacen estudios de usuario para asegurarse de que crearán herramientas de las que realmente te enamorarás. Desafortunadamente, no lograrás encontrar a muchos de ellos entrando en escena, hasta que algunos tontos hayan sufrido tratando de demostrar que la versión poco amigable de microonda si tiene mercado. En los inicios del microondas no había versiones a prueba de tontos, producidas y vendidas en masa en tiendas de artículos para el hogar. IA ha estado en ese tipo de estado inicial durante mucho tiempo, pero ahora que resulta útil, ¡los fabricantes de herramientas están avanzando! Este es un momento emocionante porque mucho de lo que crees que es difícil sobre la IA no es intelectual, sino que está relacionado con la calidad de la herramienta. A medida que las herramientas se vuelven más fáciles de usar, más personas comenzarán a ingresar a la IA y más creatividad florecerá.Inteligencia de Decisión: innovar en recetas y servir platos. Puedes pensar en esto como el lado aplicado de la ciencia de datos. Se trata de resolver problemas comerciales específicos con datos y algoritmos.Los miembros de los equipos de inteligencia de decisión trabajan para innovar en las recetas. Traerán un investigador de algoritmos a bordo si no tienen suerte con los algoritmos existentes que han probado, y traerán un ingeniero de plataformas al equipo si necesitan herramientas amigables, pero también estarán felices de subcontratar estas funciones. Están más interesados ​​en cocinar, y no sólo cualquier tipo de cocina. Son un tipo diferente de investigador, el tipo que resuelve un problema comercial imposible, inventando una receta increíble hecha a medida. Hay almacenes tras almacenes llenos de electrodomésticos e ingredientes de cocina, y su objetivo es descubrir cómo lograr conseguirte esa pizza sin calorías merecedora de una estrella Michelin.Si estás en el espacio de ML / IA aplicado, descubramos en qué fase del proyecto trabajas, y luego aumentamos el zoom para encontrar tu rol.En la vida real, a menudo hay iteraciones y retrocesos involucrados, pero aquí están las fases a grandes rasgos.Puesta en marcha: Antes de ir a jugar a la cocina, descubramos cuáles son nuestros objetivos, reunamos al equipo y preparemos nuestra cocina. Si vamos a querer acceder a los microondas, vamos a comprarlos. Si vamos a querer teletransportadores, intentemos inventarlos.Prototipo: supongamos que nuestro objetivo es hacer una salchicha vegana sin calorías que sepa a algo real. ¿Cuánto tiempo tardará? ¡Quién sabe! Tu cocina espera, ¡buena suerte!Producción: Tenemos una receta que cumple los requisitos, sirvámosla en todo el mundo durante una decada…Tomador de decisiones / gerente de producto: ¿Qué queremos servir a nuestros clientes y qué tan bueno necesita estar?

Lee más aquí.Los últimos tres roles se pueden subcontratar (a proveedores de la nube por ejemplo) si no deseas ocuparte de cosas como la configuración de la cocina o el transporte en camiones.Asegúrate de saber exactamente lo que estás vendiendo: ¿datos? ¿Algoritmos? ¿Herramientas que permiten que otros hagan IA? ¿Soluciones que utilizan IA? Mi consejo es que te concentres en tu negocio principal y dejes que otra persona se ocupe del resto por ti, siempre que sea posible.Analista: El almacén y la cocina están a oscuras.

Every vetting platform will carry implicit or explicit positions and assumptions about the charitable space — and often there is no consensus. Our particular philosophy is grounded at the intersection of the product and vision of Good Today, and there are plenty of excellent nonprofits whose work falls outside those parameters right now (i.e. nonprofits religiously affiliated, or politically-bent).Operationally, we distilled a myriad of different considerations into a point-based rubric system, with the inputs gathered primarily from online research and phone calls. There are two types of values in the rubric: binary and gradated. Binary values are for criteria when we ask “is this ok or not”? Gradated values are for criteria whose values are taken collectively.The vetting calculation is if a nonprofit checks the binary boxes and has 40+ points, the nonprofit passes our vetting system. And if there are any red flags the nonprofit will not pass unless there is a sufficient explanation and reasoning otherwise.Here is what the rubric currently looks like:There are plenty of edge cases that aren’t easily captured in the above, and we are continuously working to improve how we go about things (which is why we want to build this!). But we thought it would be helpful to summarize the main points of how things look at the moment.We always love hearing from you, let us know if you ever have any feedback!-Joe BenunTeam Good Today----1We are a nonprofit democratizing philanthropy and activism.

These relationships have been critical forces to moving our region forward in the open government movement resulting in new economic growth opportunities. The GovMaker conference has brought in talent from around the world to discuss the important work happening in their backyards and get a better understanding of how we might learn from one another. When it comes to talent, this years event is no exception to that rule.To only name a few of our distinguished guests this year:Bianca Wylie is an open government advocate with a dual background in technology and public engagement. She is the co-founder of Tech Reset Canada and is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in the Global Economy program. She worked for several years in the tech sector in operations, infrastructure, corporate training, and product management, most recently at Thomson Reuters. As a facilitator at Swerhun Inc., she designed, delivered and supported public consultation processes for various governments and government agencies. In 2014, Bianca founded the Open Data Institute Toronto. She is a columnist, guest lecturer, and speaker on open government and public sector technology policy and a member of the Toronto Public Library’s Innovation Council.(What can’t this woman do!?)Christian Bason is the chief executive of the Danish Design Centre. His role is to set the strategic direction for the organisation, and to govern the most demanding initiatives and activities. Christian is also CEO of Design Society, a foundation which is the parent company of the Danish Design Center, INDEX: Design to improve life, Global Fashion Agenda and Copenhagen Fashion Week.From 2007 to 2014, he was Director of MindLab, the Danish government’s innovation team. From 1998 to 2006, he was a consultant and business manager with the international advisory group Rambøll Management, heading the organisation and management practice.(If I listed all of the extraordinary achievements Christian has accomplished, this blog may be a novel. Read more here: http://govmakerconference.ca/christian-bason/)*psst. If you can’t already tell… we’re very excited to meet Christian. This excitement was peaked on a recent flight when I opened my Harvard Business Review magazine to find one Christian’s latest articles “The Right Way to Lead Design Thinking”.Nasma Ahmed is a technologist and community organizer based in the city we now know as Toronto. Nasma is currently the Director of the Digital Justice Lab, our mission is to build towards a more just and equitable digital future. She has extensive experience working alongside the public service and the non-profit sector, focusing on technology capacity building. She was the 2017/2018 Open Web Fellow with Mozilla and Ford Foundation, through her fellowship she worked on building organizational digital security and running a youth workshop series called “Digital Future of Privacy”.(The work that Nasma and her team engages in is worth every minute of your time to take a further peak into: The Digital Justice Lab’s mission is to focus on building a more just and equitable future.We engage with diverse communities to build alternative digital futures, here in the nation we know as Canada.

428,697,https://medium.com/@TyKyWrites/our-actions-behind-the-technology-54806274e4fb?source=tag_archive---------199-----------------------,Our Actions Behind the Technology,None,"Tylyn K. JohnsonFollow--ListenShareChildren are glued to these smart TVs, and teens to their phones, the adults using computers to get work done. Thus, their forebears are often left to struggle with figuring out this “new-fangled technology,” many of whom give up and decide that it is all useless, longing for the days of yore before technology had consumed the world they had known, calling said “gizmos” nothing but trouble. To be fair, those detractors of modern technology have something of a point, for the ease of access to information that the likes of the internet has provided society has been used with as much malice as it has been with good intentions.Social media and entertainment, which are perhaps the biggest uses of internet technology, have historically been considered sources of poor influences on our youth. This leaves one to wonder if the advances in this technology coinciding with the twenty-first century have been worth the payoff of hackers, trolls, and the potentially negative influence of other humans on the children being raised generation-to-generation. After all, even psychological research seems to indicate that the media produced with the aforementioned technology may impact people by way of the so-called “Social Learning Theory,” wherein people, especially children, learn behaviours through observation and imitation.While this “social learning” would normally happen with experiences “in real life,” social media has provided another avenue for us to learn behaviours. This is because actions such as leaving positive comments or liking videos featuring heinous actions or attitudes are happening in a public space, with the latter being given more attention than the former, which may desensitize people to the shock of such behaviours. Thus, it is the increasingly normalized widespread behaviour of said trolls and negative influences that may be negatively influencing people. And if it isn’t the negative behaviours of others online, there exists fears that “that we are beginning to design ourselves to suit digital models of us, and I worry about a leaching of empathy and humanity in that process,” so says Jaron Lanier, one of the inventors of VR.Of course, many others have been quick to argue that “technology is the future,” enough so that many people of influence, including governors and athletes, advocating for all students to learn how to code, and hundreds of articles telling college students, recent graduates, and job seekers that computer science is the end-all, be-all for anyone hoping to have a career or make a steady paycheck. And one would be remiss to forget the fact that the modernity of internet technology has made it so much easier to keep up with each other. It is no longer necessary to be chained to one’s landline by the length of its coiled cord. Now, it takes moments to order cute shirts with Amazon Prime, or an Uber home after a night of drinks, or even donate to some Kickstarter for a promising innovation that could positively-impact lives.Historically, there have been two camps when society’s communication technology is evolving: those harboring fear of said change, and the rushing towards this change. It was said that Socrates viewed the transcription of language unfavorably, while the printing press was lamented by the powerful literate. With this in mind, it is natural that the almost exponential expansion of the internet and all that is has entailed would be viewed with concern by some, and with excitement by others.Here, I would like to quote Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus, who said that “while technology is important, it’s what we do with it that truly matters.” Sure, the advent of internet technology may come with huge risks, many that have been borne out by the slew of scandals involving fake news and trolling, election tampering via social media platforms as well as massive breaches of personal data. But this technology has also opened the door wider for people to access, and act on, life-changing information like college through the Common Application, legal representation for sexual harassment victims through the “Time’s Up” campaign on GoFundMe, or simply finding love through the many dating apps that exist. Technology is important for making our day-to-day lives easier, meaning we can focus on more important issues such as economic development and improving social equity.At the end of the day, technology is merely a tool with which humans may use for any number of reasons. Like a knife can be used to cut food into pieces, to slice away at inanimate objects, or stab a living being, internet technology can be used to build other people up, to get information out there, or as a medium to attack those one disagrees with. Internet technology does not have motive, nor intent, at least not yet (Google’s founders seem to be keen on using their search engine as a means of advancing the technology for artificial intelligence). Thus, we must remember that it is how we behave this technology that will determine the progression or decline of human civilization, not the fact that it exists. After all, internet technology might be the most powerful piece of human technology aside from thermonuclear warheads, and while it can most definitely be used to end lives, it can also be used to protect us from ourselves if we go about it thoughtfully.Originally published by the NUHA Foundation in July 2018.

Yes. It is true. Technology affects our attention span shorter. We are living in the digital age. We need everything fast and quick. From booking movie tickets to ordering our delicious food, we rely on technology. Technology plays the most prominent role in our daily lives, and with the help of technology, we can achieve multiple number of tasks in a short span of time. At the same time, technology affects our attention span shorter.Since we adopt the digital lifestyle, it is difficult for us to stay focused on one particular thing. Not only that our attention span has fallen from an average of 12 seconds in the year 2000 to just 8 seconds today. Now we have less of attention span than a gold fish (9 seconds average).“You now have a shorter attention span than a goldfish”, Time magazine declared in 2015, citing a study by Microsoft Canada.In the words of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, “The true scarce commodity is increasingly human attention.” According to the study, the average human attention span is now 8 seconds.Our attention is divided because of the rise of gadgets in this digital era. It has been conclusively proved that there is a connection between shorter attention span and technology. This generation is becoming addicted to using gadgets and apps. A survey conducted in the UK in 2012 indicates that the attention span of children is getting shorter. The survey showed that 91 per cent of teachers believe that children’s attention spans are becoming shorter as they opt for screen-based activities over conventional reading.Nowadays, children could not concentrate on their studies because they are attracted towards games apps and other electronic gadgets and become oblivious of other important things happening around them. They easily develop the habit of forgetfulness because of the continuous usage of mobile phones.Living with technology is like living inside the box. For instance, we often immerse ourselves in laptops and smartphones, sidelining the things that add true value to our lives. Even children nowadays prefer compute games to outdoor games, which is an unhealthy sign for their progress.The excessive use of technology damages our brain systems connecting emotional processing, attention, and decision-making.Many mental health experts opine that a growing technology addiction will lead to an increase in attention deficit disorder and a breakdown of social relationships. It is tacitly understood that technology is something that individuals cannot survive without; we need technology to travel, entertain, cook, and many more. Everyone needs technology to survive. But, this is to an extent.An old proverb says, “Too much of anything is good for nothing”. Many research studies proved that it is not physically and psychologically healthy to use technology beyond the limit. Technology was invented for the good of mankind and so it is our duty to utilize it responsibly.----Inc.Outlook mission is to deliver quality-driven business and technology content that informs, inspires, and influences people.Inc.Outlook--Inc.Outlook--Inc.Outlook--Inc.Outlook--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Scott H.

I asked if there was a party tonight. That was also right after Dani said, “Let the robots take our jobs!” — what a great outlook, no fear.All kidding aside — it’s incredible how you can spend a whole hour on Zoom with total strangers and feel closer to them than your neighbors and/or colleagues you see every day. It’s a live stream so you have to be really attentive to what’s going and really listen to what people are saying — very intently! When you do that you actually hear and really connect to what they are saying!So if we come away with anything let it be to remember what’s really important and at the heart of everything — good human connection. That’s what makes everything else possible.That’s why I started our session called Debunking Myths — Technology Versus Humans with a quote from SESIL PIR Consulting GmbH, who I worship —“While we are undoubtedly more interconnected than ever, the work of leaders is to transform this technological interconnectedness into truly transformative social and emotional connections.” Sesil Pir @Forbes, A Human Way Of Business: Organizational Behaviors Necessary To Redefine LeadershipAfter the session I received dozens of private messages on Linkedin thanking me for moderating the session, which is quite unbelievable. I also received about 50 invitation requests. So the movement is definitely growing! This is my second time moderating, and none of that happened the first time.I woke up the next day and the first thing I saw was this amazing recap of the entire day by Blythe. I absolutely loved her story of how the first snow fall in Michigan allowed her to watch the entire event from beginning to end. Isn’t it wonderful how the universe interferes and makes sure we are exactly where we need to be?Her conclusion from watching all the panels is that we need to focus on learning in general — technology is only good if we use it to get to that higher order stuff; and that allows us to be more human and kind of bring the human back”.It’s all in her post that I copied here —STRETCHING to do many FIRSTS Today!1 — My meetings for today were cancelled due to our first Michigan snow of the season. 2 — Last night, I had just agreed to be a liaison for the Grand Rapids Hacking HR chapter and was told about an all-day session today by the encouraging Enrique Rubio. Now, I could attend! 3 — It was many hours of a global and virtual conference. LinkedIn Live with many interesting and thought provoking panelists on the Upskilling and Reskilling for the Future of Work. 4 — I also recorded a short video on what I learned. Please watch and tell me what you think!I have to credit Cecile with getting the warm connection in our panel going the day before. Here is a post about our fun prep call , and she sent me her notes to post along with the photo — notice how we posed as if we’re actually talking to each other …..Merci Cecile Alper-Leroux 😍 I was so nervous about moderating our Hacking HR panel tomorrow — Debunking Myths: Technology Versus Humans at 9.30 a.m. (the 12th) So I was thrilled to connect with Cecile for a few minutes and hear her thoughts: Myth 1: The 4th industrial revolution means machines will replace humans 💡 No, it will change every job, without a doubt, but it could and should be the industrial revolution that ⚡humanizes our workplaces⚡, by taking monotonous work off our plates… the aging workforce and shrinking labor pool will require a reskilling/redistribution of people who CAN be replaced by automation to the vast number of unfilled jobs that exist today already! This will require changing our paradigms and the education system. Myth 2: Machines will do everything better than us in 15 years (Elon Musk) 💡Not true. There are so many things humans will always do better or can only do. For example, ⚡forming human connection and relationships⚡ is not something machines do well and it is the critical factor in building positive organizational cultures. Reskilling for the #future means creating an adaptive workforce because change is constant.What can I say? Thank you to Enrique Rubio for being such an incredible shining light for so many people! Thank you for creating this space for us all to shine in together! Let’s keep pushing forward no matter what and be sure to nurture all these wonderful new connections!

With no compromises on decentralization, security, transparency as well as high cost efficiency and transactions throughput.This and more, is HybridverseBlockchain technology has a broad range of applications across many sectors, insurtech, fintech, legaltech, data processing, supply-chain and much more. According to the World Economic Forum, 10% of the Global GDP will be built on blockchains by 2027 and this technology (along with IoT and AI) will lead the transition to the new Industry 4.0, reshaping society as we know it.However, blockchain technology isn’t easy to access (yet), to the extent that it fails to provide seamless integration for a critical mass of new users that are willing to adopt and integrate, but in order to do so, are required to either build the technology from scratch (if they possess sector-specific skills and “know how” that in most of the cases they don’t have) especially at a business level given the learning curve required, are forced to rely on external consulting for the partial or whole development process, forcing them to hand out their data and customers to third parties, these are risk factors increasing the invested time and resources.Those listed challenges, are posing a constraint for widespread adoption and in order to solve them, this Paper proposes a technology that enables to integrate multiple and different decentralized applications (dApps) running with the same business logic across different blockchains with a Plug & Play approach. Hybridverse enables the integration of blockchain technology without having to possess sector-specific coding skills, providing different purposes and use cases that can be implemented across different industries and business models. We are proposing a“universe” of Plug & Play, multi-purpose, secure, dApps ranging from real world data validation and verification, to E-voting, from end-to-end generation of digital assets, to decentralized exchanges, from stablecoins, to multi-currency wallets and more. This technology is called Hybridverse.If you’re part of the TL;DR “Too long, didn’t read” club, or if you want more focused information, just stay tuned aswe’ll be rolling out snippets of Hybrid Paper with a lot of material for you to do more research and find the piece of Hybridverse you’re searching for in order to make an informed decision.----Integrate blockchain applicationsHybridverse Blockchain--Hybridverse Blockchain--Hybridverse Blockchain--Hybridverse Blockchain--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Crypto with RobertoinCoinmonks--11HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Hybridverse Blockchain,https://medium.com/,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*PWH41JwigO_Epzvze9D-xQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*qDEQw8gzB4u9BDwGaa_3lg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*SBnjWaIOGoGywQElwoZFKQ.png",3,3

The innovation that underlies the advanced cash bitcoin has changed our impression of what comprises cash just as the capacity and exchange of significant worth.Be that as it may, what makes the blockchain genuinely progressive is its potential for applications past preparing bitcoin exchanges. Today, there are several new businesses that are utilizing blockchain innovation to upset a variety of ventures, for example, exchange money, human services, distributed storage and cybersecurity, among some more.In spite of the expansive number of enterprises that the blockchain is affecting, there are additionally concerns with respect to the innovation that are as yet keeping its across the board appropriation.1. Beginning CostsIn spite of the fact that the appropriation of blockchain innovation guarantees long haul benefits concerning profitability, proficiency, auspiciousness and diminished costs, it is costly to at first set up it. The product required to run blockchain innovation in associations should commonly be created for the particular firm and is along these lines costly to buy, get or create in-house. In addition, associations may need to get particular equipment for use with the product.Notwithstanding the product costs, associations should likewise discover qualified staff to work pair with the innovation. The blockchain innovation space is moderately new and is developing at such a quick rate, to the point that experts capable in the field are rare. Because of the substantial interest and restricted supply, associations must be eager to pay expansive pay rates to the people who are met all requirements for these positions.This implies a move to a total or even fractional blockchain-based framework is distant for most little and medium-sized business because of the high setup costs included.2. Coordination With Legacy SystemsSo as to make the move to a blockchain-based framework, an association should either totally update their past framework or figure out how to coordinate their current framework with the blockchain arrangement.Be that as it may, it might be troublesome for blockchain answers for handle all capacities required by associations, at first making it hard to totally kill inheritance frameworks. Subsequently, impressive changes must be made to the current frameworks so as to encourage a smooth progress. This procedure may take a lot of time, assets and human skill.Sometimes, it might be undoable to accommodate the two frameworks, and the associations must gain new frameworks that are good with the blockchain arrangement. Numerous associations are hesitant to make the move to blockchain arrangements due to the fastidious arranging, time and cash that would be required so as to accomplish fruitful far reaching usage.3. Vitality ConsumptionThe Bitcoin arrange, just as the Ethereum organize, both utilize the confirmation of-work component to approve exchanges made on the blockchains. This instrument requires the calculation of complex numerical issues to check and process exchanges and to anchor the system. These figurings require a lot of vitality to control the PCs taking care of the issues.

I said sure, and donned a semi-visible cape in a highly entertaining photo shoot.The concept of the campaign is that it takes many diverse but passionate people to change healthcare, and that regular folks can, working together, achieve superhero-like feats. Since each of the “champions” featured in the campaign has a moniker (“the Consumerista” — which, thanks to Todd Park, I actually used to be called in real life — didn’t fit the HIMSS syntax), I became the “the Communicator.”The Communicator fits, I think. For one, my name, Lygeia, means “clear voiced” in ancient Greek, and I do strive to communicate in a metaphorically clear voice, whether in writing, conversation, or public speaking. For another, my dear husband sometimes says I talk too much, so there may be something to it.Throughout my career I’ve communicated a lot about the untapped power of healthcare consumers, and how unleashing it through technology can change healthcare for the better. I’ve also served as a translator, frequently bridging gaps in communication among diverse stakeholder groups. It’s fun to continue to do so, having recently switched stakeholder groups myself, becoming a tech entrepreneur at Carium as opposed to a consultant, or a policy maker, or a foundation officer — all of which have helped me learn and gain perspective on health IT in the past.I hope my rather unorthodox career path and the fun I’m having along the way will encourage others earlier in their careers to find and relentlessly follow something they are passionate and curious about, too. The world is changing so quickly now — especially technology — you’re better off being flexible about what you consider your profession to be, I think. But don’t waver from championing whatever change you want to see in the world — and make sure you communicate early and often with peers — as HIMSS would say, champions of change are most likely to succeed if we unite!The interview I did for HIMSS as part of the “Champions of Change” campaign is posted here.

442,29751,https://medium.com/@julienlengrand/creating-communities-consistency-is-paramount-1ab888eb69c?source=tag_archive---------63-----------------------,Creating communities : Consistency is paramount,None,"julien lengrand-lambertFollow--ListenShareAs part of my job as IT Chapter Lead at ING, I am responsible for the ‘mastery’ of my chapter members. What that means is that I need to make sure they are basically on top of their game, and keep growing (in the direction they want!).I do most of this via one-on-one meetings. I quickly realized around me that a large portion of my colleagues do not go to Meetups, and do not do any programming at home. That’s of course ok, but coming from small companies where everyone was very passionate I didn’t expect it. However, I strongly believe that one does not stay technically relevant / become better simply by performing his daily tasks. After all, most of what we do as developers is simple plumbing, and the tasks that really activate us are scarce. This is especially true in large companies where most of the work is on top of existing applications.Most developers in our company of course go to conferences one or twice a year. But is twice a year enough to keep someone motivated in his craft? It surely is part of it.For the past year and a half, I have set myself to the task of creating more opportunities for people to get ‘inspired’ and take pride in that beautiful job we are doing. I do that in two main different ways :Lunchspirations started very small, but are now getting bigger and bigger. In June only, we received Google over and Trisha Gee from Jetbrains. We now have sessions planned with Spotify, AWS, Azure, Gitlab and more and the last session hosted more than 80 people! I am so happy to see the same people I was talking about above get out of those sessions inspired, dying to try more at home. We are even starting in new locations and countries now!For Lunchspirations and the blog alike, content is now coming my way and I don’t have to chase for it as much any more. But it wasn’t always like that! I took more than 4 months of work to go through all the hoops needed to get the blog started, and a long uphill battle to find people to create content. Finding our first speakers for the Lunchspirations also was a challenge and I had to get out of my way to get the whole idea started.What I learnt from the past 6 years creating communities is that your best ally is consistency. Don’t put in crazy amount of work as it is not sustainable. Invest some time in it, but in a consistent manner and keep doing it no matter what!I have been running several Meetups over the years. The Coffee, Code and Chat meetup is now more than 1k people large, and as I am writing this I am with about 10 other hackers. We don’t hold presentations, or invite speakers like other Meetups. We just meet, have coffee together and work on our own projects. People even have to pay for their coffee! Still, we are the 5th biggest Tech Meetup in Utrecht. How? For the past 5 years I have been there every single Saturday, consistently. For a while, we were 2, or 3. But numbers started growing, we have had sessions with more than 25 people ! The numbers went down for the last year, but I am confident that this Meetup will survive me the day I leave.Over the years, I have seen so many Meetups and communities die. They start, fly high for a couple months and one day they simply stop. Most often after less than a year.You want to create a community? You don’t have to be a rockstar. You don’t have to have kickass venues. Just be pleasant and consistent. Over and over again. People will find you.Originally published at https://lengrand.fr on June 22, 2019.----Developer Advocate @Adyen. Dad. I create ‘islands’ where engineers are the heroes.

445,45885,https://medium.com/@alexlotun21/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-270af441eb48?source=tag_archive---------174-----------------------,The Fourth Industrial Revolution,None,"AlexlotunFollow--ListenShareA reality of nowAs many know the industrial revolutions were both economic and social transformation processes, where the world underwent major changes in innovation and ways of making work processes more efficient and easier for people. The first industrial transformation dealt with mechanization with the appearance of the steam railway, also the appearance of coal and oil, among others. The second industrial revolution came about with the discovery of electric energy, replacing the use of steam engines. From there we move on to the third revolution where computer science, the first PCs and tics (information and communication technologies) began to be seen for the first time. And finally, the fourth revolution, which I will talk about next, taking as reference the book with the same title, of the author and the first person who gave the subject: Klaus Schwab.We started with a book of the year 2016. Although it is only 3 years old, innovation in technology has been exponential to realize that certain things that are raised in the book have already been behind or are found point of doing it. At first, I had the impression that it was a book of today and that the fourth revolution was industrial, but no, as I read, I could realize that these are arguments that seek to demonstrate the existence of that revolution. Klaus says there are drivers for this revolution, which are mega trends and inflection points.Megatrends are all of them that “take advantage of the penetration power that digitalization and information technologies have” (Schwab, 2016), which is indeed right. Now quickly anything is disseminated with impressive speed and many of these times we also participate in these trends, such as memes (now censorship is close to any type of image that refers to the attack of the twin towers ) But this does not mean that trends are only for negative or worthless things, they can also be used for people’s well-being.The turning points are “times when specific technological changes have an impact on society in general” (Schwab, 2016). In the table attached to the inflection points I was very surprised by what happened before 2025, although of course, this is simple speculation, seeing the big picture that is believed to be the world at that time is very surprising. Two of the ones that caught my attention were that we will have clothes that are connected to the internet and that there is the first implanted phone, things that we may have seen in some futuristic movie. And the reality is that we are too close to this science fiction become reality.In the biotechnology part, where the ethical criterion of genetic modifications enters, it is something that from my point of view is good, since with this technology we can include if any baby before birth can have a chronic problem and with the genetic modification make it born with perfect health. But of course, there is also the fact that there will be people who want to make their future children born with some specific trait, being from the Catholic point of view something ethically incorrect, since from their perspective it emphasizes that they will not want their children such and how will they comeOn the issue of employment, considering that having greater technological innovation, jobs will decrease instead of increasing. Contrary to what is said in the book, that with this innovative boom there will be more jobs but in turn some will decrease. Sounds opposite, but it is. When a new technology emerges, processes are saved, resulting in the reduction of labor, but in turn generates jobs in the new needs of this technology. But if we think things through these new needs, they are more “complicated”, so the hiring process would be more stringent since it would be necessary to have new knowledge and then generate more consumption of information and training, which from my point from view, it could generate “new jobs” but in a more delayed way, it would be like returning to study at the university. Therefore, the percentage given by the Oxford Martin program (on technology and employment) so far this decade is lower than the past. But I feel that to some extent it would be the increase in jobs, since as we have seen, man has the desire to create machines that do all the work for them. Presence that can happen as in any film where robots are able to reason and think about the destruction and waste of man since the machines are more efficient than us.As I said, companies that emerge from innovation are increasingly complex, but easy to use because they are very intuitive. With the era of digitalization, you can now search for a product of your interest from the comfort of your home using any smart device. This generates that companies are constantly changing, since with this facility that users have their tastes and preferences are very volatile. And of course, all this generates that consumers of these smart devices spend hours and hours using them, being dependent on them and enslaving them to their consumption.Then the excessive use of these media means that companies want to enter to provide their services on the web, but many of them do not think that with their structure and way of sale they will continue to generate the same income. Such was the case of blockbuster, this company specialized in the rental of films, novels, series, video games, etc .; he never took steps towards innovation, thus stalling in the only thing he did, instead another company that if he pointed to the “future” made that instead of going to the store, rent the movie and return to their homes, all this could be done from a click on their homes, through the application of this company (Netflix).Well, and if companies and mass media go to the web, wouldn’t this generate a lot of false information, misuse of media and all kinds of theft (identity, informational hackers, etc.)? Nowadays it is like that, a regulator for this type of dangers that generate surfing the internet has not yet been created, therefore, although it is said that one of the purposes of the fourth industrial revolution is the control and regulation of this, I feel I am a very complicated issue to handle, but we have been booming for 13 years using the internet and despite being “little” time, it has been regulated quite little. There are thousands of people who steal information, and, although websites are becoming increasingly secure so that hackers cannot enter to steal information, they still exist and manage to penetrate security, there is still very bad use of this medium and I know that it is one of the purposes and challenges, but I think we are far from reaching that point.Such is the case of the Stuxnet virus created by unknown hackers. This virus was one of the first that was known about cyber warfare, which was passed through pendrives (usb) and at the beginning when it was discovered it was not known what it was intended. It took 6 months until Kaspersky, the antivirus company NOD32 realized what he was doing, and it was manipulation of PLCs that are dumb computers to which you can program specific tasks, for example the robots that are used in the assemblers of cars, where each of these have different uses. But you will ask yourself, what does this have to do with it? Well, it was investigated which was the most affected country and they realized that it was an Iranian company where uranium treatment was done, which at first was responsible for promoting nuclear energy in the country, but they turned aside and began to create their own nuclear weapons. The fact is that there were centrifugal plants for the treatment of uranium which this virus attacked every two months causing the centrifuges to accelerate to the point that they decomposed. This was nothing remarkable, so it took a long time for it to be discovered. But let’s imagine how sinister the programmers were to be able to create such a specific virus. It is a very scary topic.At the end of the paragraph “towards a safer world”, he tells the author of the book that he is afraid that more and more technologies are being created that are capable of having a high level of specialization, resulting in humans stop thinking, confronting challenges, analyzing and managing opportunities, and as I said before, we can reach the degree that these artificial intelligences surpass us and are more intelligent than us, to the extent that their own common reason thinks that we are useless beings in the world and that we need to be discarded, too with the ability that almost everything they do will have a very low margin of error.We point out that by using our cell phones more we lose contact with people and become less social and empathic. This also suggests that soon we lose the ability to talk to others, read body language, listen, etc. Our ability to think could also deteriorate since this device does everything for us.This section of the book talks a lot about automation, which is that applications, robots and / or artificial intelligence replace simple jobs. An example given at the beginning is that of Blockchain, which is a platform where you can keep your accounting without the need to have a specific area in your organization. This alarmed me a lot since I am studying accounting, and to think that in the next years my services will no longer be used, and that all the time I study will be replaced by a platform, it makes me think that I should have studied something else.Many of these problems are solved by our way of doing things, because we, who create these technological innovations, are ourselves, to whom we must know to what extent to arrive with such a discovery and know the consequences that can be generated when it is done . That is why Klaus says that we must have contextual, emotional, inspired and physical intelligence, that all this alludes to that we must be flexible and aware of what is happening, that we should not be caught in the fear of what will happen, that we should stop thinking about ourselves, that we have to think about the collective good and that we must be in harmony.It is a very complicated path that the book poses to adequately achieve the fourth industrial revolution, but I know that as technologies evolve, we also evolve as people and that we can take advantage of this revolution to compose our mistakes. the past, like pollution; that we can generate more jobs and reduce poverty rates. We are the only reasonable and thinking living beings, and we can understand that we are deviating, but we can remedy it and make our world something better for future generations.----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Alexlotun,https://medium.com/@alexlotun21,0,8,1

Only then will they power applications that are innovative, and social- and user-centric.Data, connectivity and new technologies can help people gain access to education, work, health services and mobility. They also help tackle issues such as inequality, poverty and environmental threats. New technologies will transform society in a vastly positive way, but only if they are applied carefully, and with consideration of their wider impacts. Many data-driven projects maintain explicitly positive social goals, such as Fluttr, a digital hiring platform that removes bias from the hiring process, and Accenture’s “ Million Meals “ initiative.Accenture’s “Million Meals” project taps into a mixture of IoT, blockchain and AI to help provide millions of meals to Indian schoolchildren. Blockchain gathers feedback, IoT sensors measure food delivery and AI predicts what food is needed tomorrow.As the possibilities of data-driven innovation expand, so too does awareness of the negative implications. Human bias present in training data can easily be amplified to create machine learning models that are inadvertently discriminatory. The implications may be especially critical in high-stake scenarios, such as immigration and law-enforcement, but also in situations such as personnel hiring and financial-liability assessments. Similar bias can also stem from homogenous training data. A lack of diversity in training data, for example, has been suggested as the cause of the Google Photo AI mislabeling black people as gorillas.We can think of AI as a mirror — something that reflects not only the data it’s trained with, but also the typical cultural homogeneity of those who develop it. Neural networks and machine learning may be great for uncovering and amplifying patterns, but it often does so without consideration of whether those patterns have positive or negative impacts on humankind. By mirroring our society, AI forces us to face up to our biases and flaws. We must therefore critically question, reevaluate, and redefine our values and beliefs to ensure the impacts of new products and services remain positive. A greater emphasis is already being placed on ethics and data standards, and many frameworks are being developed to address these challenges.Fast.ai’s mission is to make deep learning easier, and to involve more people from all backgrounds during all stages of AI development.To help technology deliver a more positive future, we need to embrace a common and global ethics framework, applicable both for data collection (enforcing privacy regulations and anonymization) and training-data choices. Increasing awareness of potential risks should also mean that greater emphasis is placed on developing solutions that are ethically and morally sound.OrCam’s MyEye is an assistive device for the blind and visually impaired. It uses AI to read text, recognize faces and even identify products, transforming the lives of the visually impaired. © OrCamEfforts to make technology fairer and more ethical must be matched with a push towards diversity and inclusivity in the real world. Debate also continues as to what exactly constitutes “ethical and responsible” AI development — there will be no simple answer to this question, which will vary significantly across different cultures and countries. The question therefore remains: is technology a unifying force for good that bridges divided societies and nationalities, and unites humanity?The full report is available for download.Originally published at https://360.here.com.----HEREHERE, a location data and technology platform, moves people, businesses and cities forward by harnessing the power of location.HERE TechnologiesinHERE--HERE TechnologiesinHERE--HERE TechnologiesinHERE--HERE TechnologiesinHERE--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Christina SainUX Planet--64Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",HERE Technologies,https://medium.com/@here,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*0G30mwjhvQT6KB_-nKBffQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*yYMEZ9C0zkxiEdip.jpeg",3,0

The events could be clicks coming from the advertisement, or installs or any other activity on the advertised app. It is very common for Applift to see 100s of millions of events per day. Very often we have to respond to these events in milliseconds. We need the shortest response time possible for two main reasons:There are also several other use cases which are more complex and involve multiple moving parts.Following is a simplified architecture for event processing in Applift. Data flows into Applift’s system via users interacting with ads or third-party systems into any of our web services. This data is put into a corresponding data pipeline. Various internal services react to these events and consume/produce more data. Data also flows out of Applift to various third parties.Most of the services in Applift are real-time as per the demand of the business and can be scaled to any number of instances. These services interact together using data pipelines or HTTP APIs. This data ingress-egress is known as traffic, which has the following characteristics:Business requirements and the traffic scenarios made it crucial to have a load testing framework where we can keep the system constantly under load and can change the load on demand. At this point, we are ready to draft a requirement for the load testing system:We evaluated Jmeter, Gatling, and locust for the purpose of the load testing. All of them were have strong pros and cons. Comparison of all the popular load testing tools can be found here. I will write another article on my own findings, but for now, we found locust to be the best fit on the above minimum requirements.Locust is essentially a load testing framework written in Python where you have a master and multiple slave instances. On the master instance, you start a test by specifying the number of users and hatch rate (rate of users connecting per second). The master distributes the number of users and hatch rate across all the connected slaves.Note : 100 users connecting with a hatch-rate of 10 per second means, locust will execute a maximum of 100 locust tasks in parallel, while increasing the parallelism by 10 tasks per secondA locust task is a minimum unit of work. A task is stateless. Some examples of tasks are:In Figure 2, slaves are capable of running different types of tasks. Each task has a name and a weight. The locust master manages execution at slaves in such a manner that higher weighted the task runs more frequently than the lower ones.Note: The run ratio of the tasks is not perfectly at sync with the weight ratio as there are multiple factors at play here.Slaves report the metrics back to the locust master which keeps aggregating this data. The data from the locust master can be queried in the following forms:Now that we have a rough idea of how locust works, we will evaluate locust for the minimum requirements we defined earlier.Spec 1: We want to load test not only the web services but the whole cluster: Locust is capable of testing any arbitrary protocol and locust can trigger multiple types of tasks at any scale. This enabled us to target each service in the cluster to mimic actual production behavior.Spec2: We want to increase and decrease the load on a service: Multiple slaves can be started with different weights assigned to a task to control the load. It is easy to upscale and downscale the number of slaves.Spec3: We want detailed, powerful and descriptive means to understand the performance results: The default reports from locust are quite brief, but locust slaves can be changed to calculate and write metrics to any system. We could write them in Prometheus and build a powerful dashboard using Grafana.So locust does fit well into the requirements but there were several other additional benefits that affected the decision:In this post, we briefly discussed load testing requirements at Applift. In the next post, I will go into detail on how to write slaves for locust in golang. I will also share some code on how we deploy our load testing service at Kubernetes cluster and how it can be extended to accommodate more tasks----Engineering @ Appliftmangatmodi.com | High scalable services, Low latency coding, and Concurrency!

In a recent paper, Google Brain researchers leveraged the advantages of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to propose NAS-FPN, a new automatic search method for feature pyramid architecture. NAS-FPN achieves a better accuracy and latency tradeoff than current SOTA models for object detection.From the paper’s abstract:“Here we aim to learn a better architecture of feature pyramid network for object detection. We adopt Neural Architecture Search and discover a new feature pyramid architecture in a novel scalable search space covering all cross-scale connections. The discovered architecture, named NAS-FPN, consists of a combination of top-down and bottom-up connections to fuse features across scales. NAS-FPN, combined with various backbone models in the RetinaNet framework, achieves better accuracy and latency tradeoff compared to state-of-the-art object detection models. NAS-FPN improves mobile detection accuracy by 2 AP compared to state-of-the-art SSDLite with MobileNetV2 model in [32] and achieves 48.3 AP which surpasses Mask R-CNN [10] detection accuracy with less computation time.” (arXiv).Synced invited Dr. Dawei Du, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the State University of New York with a research focus on visual tracking, object detection and video segmentation applications, to share his thoughts on Google Brain’s NAS-FPN.How would you describe NAS-FPN?FPN is a pyramid representation for deep learning that combines low-resolution but strong semantic features and weak semantic but high-resolution features via top-down and lateral connections. Moreover, NAS-FPN is an automatic neural architecture search algorithm that focuses on finding optimal connections between different layers for pyramidal representations.Specifically, the RNN controller is trained to select the best architecture using reinforcement learning. First the child networks are sampled by combining any two different layers. Then the accuracy score is regarded as the reward of reinforcement learning to calculate the policy gradient to update the parameters of the controller. During the training iterations, it is possible to generate the structure with better accuracy via the controller. Experiments on the COCO test set show the proposed method achieves considerable accuracy improvement compared to existing object detection models, e.g., MobileNetV2, and RetinaNet.Why does this research matter?Deep learning dominates various tasks in computer vision. However, the majority of the previous works focuses on training the parameters of networks in human-designed architectures. Recently, there has been increasing interest in designing the structure of neural networks automatically. Xie et al. explored randomly wired neural networks for image recognition. Liu et al. proposed searching the network level structure in addition to the cell level structure for semantic segmentation. Differing from the aforementioned work, this paper provides another research direction that makes it possible to search the optimal cross-layer connections to achieve discriminative multiscale feature representation of neural networks.What impact might this research bring to the research community?Combing multi-scale features from different layers is one of the important techniques in deep learning for effectively improving the performance of many computer vision tasks. However, the previously proposed human-designed structures may be not optimal, resulting in limited performance. Inspired by NAS-FPN, researchers can transfer the optimal network structures to related tasks such as visual tracking and semantic segmentation.Can you identify any bottlenecks in the research?The computational complexity of NAS is extremely high (100 TPUs used in this paper), especially for complex backbones (e.g., ResNet-101). Therefore, it is very difficult to follow for labs without many computational resources. Besides, we still know little about the insights of the optimal network generated by the NAS method. Why such layer connection combinations achieve better performance than human-designed ones? Can we learn from the network design and transfer to other tasks (e.g., tracking, segmentation and classification)? The interpretation of it remains unsolved due to the complex cross-layer connections.Can you predict any potential future developments related to this research?I believe there will be much work using the NAS method in the future. According to prior knowledge of a specific task, researchers can reduce the NAS search space by pruning some unnecessary connections. Besides, some effective modules will be found based on similar connections of optimal networks in different tasks. It is interesting to think about designing a network that considers the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, especially in embedded systems with limited resources.The paper NAS-FPN: Learning Scalable Feature Pyramid Architecture for Object Detection is on arXiv.About Dr. Dawei DuDawei Du is a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Computer Science Department at the University at Albany, State University of New York.

Do you remember the Python Installation post? Together with the installation of the Visual Studio Code? Well, now, let’s do some exercises to show how python works — some basics stuff.We will be using VSCode, but feel free to use Jupyter Notebook to check your code step by step.Let’s start the work. We are assuming you already have VSCode and Python.The first idea is to read a file text and find the weekdays whenever they appeared after a line that starts with the “From” word. We will be using this file.In the first line, we are opening the file and creating an object that contains every line in the document. The second line is running a loop to work with each line into the file object. Each line into the document comes with a format using spaces, so, to remove that, we use the third line. The method rstrip allows us to clean the white spaces between lines. Now we are ready to transform the line texts into lists for work in our idea.When we need to perform some logic, first, we need to check for ourselves what is required to do. In the text, we find that after every line, we sometimes find an email address and a date starting with the weekday. In other cases, we see the email address only. Ok, above, we did transform that logic. There we have some things to point out.What we did was, having the sentences in lists, ask for the first position in the list that in python is position 0. When the word in the first position is “From” we need to check for those that only have the email address after. Another thing to check is being sure that the list we are using has three or more positions because, if it is not the case, it is going to raise an error. After those checks, we just need to pick up the word in the third position, position 2 in python, because positions start with 0.Let’s see the resultsConclusionIn this post, we read a file with some code to do something easy. Stay tunned future post will follow the same idea.Thanks for reading----We are a team of passionate Engineers about where Deep learning / AI will take us in the next 5 years, we focus our job in deep learning applications.TECHNO PREMIUM--TECHNO PREMIUMinDeep learning benchmark tool | DLBT--1TECHNO PREMIUM--TECHNO PREMIUM--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Anmol TomarinCodeX--49Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--44Graham ZemelinThe Gray Area--16Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Martin HeinzinBetter Programming--5HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",TECHNO PREMIUM,https://medium.com/@technopremiumusa,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*vspSEbuAqkNzVsB6.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*0lG9Wn1C-h9AjL9_.png",3,0

You’ve likely seen dozens of news headlines about how AI and machine learning is being used in all kinds of industries in order to improve efficiency and save money. But the fact is that setting up those AI systems is a very difficult task that requires a great deal of specialized expertise. That makes it prohibitively expensive for small businesses to develop their own AI models. But Xnor’s new AI2GO service provides ready-to-use AI models for machine learning on the edge.The Xnor AI2GO service relies on the fact that most small business can benefit from existing artificial intelligence models. If you own a retail store and want to keep track of how many customers enter and exit the store, how long they browse, and which areas they spend the most time in, developing your own machine learning model would be difficult. You’d have to have the expertise to even understand how machine learning works, the technical skill to set up the system, and the resources to compile the material to train your model. Luckily that is a common use-case, and one that Xnor’s AI2GO service can provide a turnkey AI model for.The service is straightforward enough that any technically-proficient person should be able to utilize it to deploy an AI model. All you have to do is select your platform, such as a Raspberry Pi 3, choose an industry, and then select the specific machine learning model you want to use. You’ll then be given a software package to download and install, and the AI will already be trained and ready to go. After signing up for an AI2GO account, you can start experimenting with the service for free. Then, if you’re ready to deploy your AI in a commercial setting, you can apply for a license. Updates and bug fixes are automatically pushed to your device, so you don’t have to worry about maintenance.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--1Cameron Coward--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Leonie MonigattiinTowards Data Science--13Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Unbecoming--768Molly RubyinTowards Data Science--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Cameron Coward,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*3F7nAdih7MUL7VnUYNB_8A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*yYXsBxa3rKqjZ3WLWK1d0A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*tR-jNXEQIlTnHDyLChWiQQ.png",2,59

As predicted by Forbes, one in every four cars on the roads with being fully autonomous in the next decade.However, a decade is quite a long time and full autonomy is still far from reach. Researches conducted by J.D. Power and the law company Miller Canfield reveals that 52 percent of respondents wouldn’t ride in an autonomous vehicle, even if the car met all the necessary safety standards, with only 2 percent definitely taking a ride in these vehicles.The skepticism can be credited to the many failures Autonomous Vehicle companies have encountered in the past couple of years. Accidents have been a frequent case when it comes to testing self-driven cars. At times due to machine failures and at times the test drivers being at fault. Whatever the case may be, the companies behind the engineering of these vehicles still have a long way to go to perfect the technology before introducing them for public use.WAYMO HAD FACED NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS THUS FAROne of the leading companies in self-driven cars, Waymo has seen several failures in the past couple of years. It was in June of last year that an autonomous minivan developed by the self-driving tech company had crashed on the highway in California. The fact behind the incident remains that the safety driver behind the wheels had accidentally fallen asleep. Although the vehicle was being operated by an autonomous software, the driver was supposed to be fully awake and attentive. However, after falling asleep, he accidentally pressed the gas pedal. This action turned off the autonomous mode. Since the driver didn’t take control of the steering wheel, it didn’t take long before Waymo’s car crashed into the highway median. Luckily, no one was hurt, and no other cars were involved in the accident. Although the car did suffer damage to its bumper and tires.READ ALSO AI’s DEEP NEURAL NETWORK and DEEP LEARNINGEarlier, Waymo relied on two human drivers during test drives but decided to reduce the number to one. This, however, did not turn out to be a smart move on their side. Apart from the California incident, the company has seen 12 car crash cases in the previous year itself. So, whoever Waymo might blame for the accidents, it is evident that autonomous cars can get into accidents as easily as traditional vehicles.MERCEDES PLANS ON TEACHING AUTONOMOUS CARS DECIDED LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONSSafety on the roads is always a priority. But when it comes to self-driven cars, whose safety should be prioritized? And who should be deciding this?Imagine a car that will do anything necessary to protect its passengers, even if that means hitting a pedestrian. This is precisely what Mercedes is planning to develop. The plan is to for the autonomous technology to give priority to the safety of the passenger(s) at all costs, in potentially dangerous situations. “If you know you can save at least one person, at least save that one. Save the one in the car,” says Christoph von Hugo, the Manager of Driver Assistance Systems at Mercedes-Benz.The system is designed in a way such that if a pedestrian comes in front of the car all of a sudden, the car, instead of swerving and hitting any obstacle, would hit the pedestrian, putting the safety of the passenger as primary. This raised a few ethical questions. What if the driver would rather choose to swerve and avoid the pedestrian? As Mercedes continues to develop this technology, it will certainly create more controversy in the future.UBER’S SELF-DRIVING TESTS DRIVES CAUSED FATAL ACCIDENTArizona had become the kind of the official testing grounds for testing out Automated Vehicles. Companies like Waymo and Uber had, for a long time, been testing the progress of their self-driven cars around the state. However, a lot of questions were raised after Uber’s self-driving vehicle killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The accident involved a 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg on the streets of Arizona at 10 pm crossing a dangerous stretch of road that did not have any pedestrian crossing in the vicinity. Even though the car had special sensor tech capable of detecting obstacles, especially at night, the vehicle failed to detect the pedestrian and struck her.READ ALSO Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural NetworksSimilar to the Waymo incident, this case too involved a safety driver who was not paying attention to the road and neither had her hands on the steering wheel. This had forced Uber to suspend its testing programs in Arizona, San Francisco, and Toronto.TESLA FOLLOWS SUIT5 days after the Uber incident in Arizona, a Tesla SUV, modified to run on driver-less technology on autopilot mode crashed into a road divider in Mountain View, California, killing its driver. The deceased was an Apple engineer Walter Huang, who, according to ABC report, had, on several occasions complained the Tesla dealership about how the vehicle in Autopilot mode veered towards the same barrier. Tesla blamed the severity of the crash on a missing piece in the road divider. In a later update, Tesla seemed to blame human error, as well.In this incident, the autopilot had been enabled, giving warnings to the driver of a possible collision but the driver was unable to take control of the vehicle at that moment. Costa Samaras, an Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and an Adjunct Senior Researcher at the RAND Corporation stated that “Drivers that use a robotic system or artificial intelligence to improve their driving may be able to prevent crashes. But when humans are the backup systems, we’re pretty bad at doing that. This is a challenge for this transition to automation, where there’s this muddled mixture of human responsibility and robot responsibility.”CONTINGENCY APPROACHIt is well understood that there other are issues, apart from technical ones which need to be sorted out before these automated vehicles can be introduced on the roads safely. In light of recent events, Nebraska’s State Senator, Suzanne Geist introduced a bill that would make the manufacturer of the self-driving technology liable in a crash involving a vehicle capable of the “entire driving task” and operating in autonomous mode. In the instance of a car operating together with a driver, such as a vehicle with a lane-keeping assist, the driver would be liable.READ ALSO World’s first AI News Anchor — Future of Media IndustryThe bill in question, Legislative Bill 142 is an attempt to not only clarify who is liable but to standardize that across the nation, based on guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Traffic Safety Administration last summer. It also requires manufacturers of automated driving systems to have at least $5 million worth of liability insurance and $1 million of insurance per vehicle, per accident.CONCLUSIONIf we were to look back a few years, vehicles without a human behind the wheel would seem completely unrealistic, but now, things have changed. Self-driving tech developers are already testing their latest innovations on our roads. However, before we start looking forward to a driver-less future, serious safety concerns need to be addressed. Until that happens, predictions claiming autonomous cars will soon be as common as traditional vehicles on our roads seem hard to believe.We really appreciate you stopping by and hanging with us!

From mountain goats to whales, choppers have provided surveying aids to the zoologists. However, when it came to personal safety, copters were found to be very vulnerable to sensitive situations. With several fatalities in aviation accidents, the helicopters were marked as a dangerous surveying instrument. The daunting statistic of lost biologists and technicians compelled the developer to undertake innovative measure.Once developed as an object of entertainment, drone technology could be the missing answer to all the security questions. Presently, with digitization spreading across the industrial ecosystem, scientists and biologists are fortifying drones to gather informative data. Integration of drone technology into the wildlife monitoring framework has set the standard of innovations even higher. Ecologists are increasing the use of drones for accurately measuring and predicting the mass of animal colonies, which is further enhancing the speed of study. As the ground crew remotely controls unmanned hovering vehicles, the risk of encountering life-threatening accidents is eliminated completely.Traditionally, the assessment of accurately counting wild animals is not only extremely challenging but also very time-consuming. However, with the bird-eye view approach provided by drone technology, researchers can easily have a perfect overview of the entire population of a colony.Previously, the audible turbulence caused by the functioning of heavy motors from helicopters developed a state of anxiety, which further complicated the monitoring activity. On the flip side, the uncrewed automated vehicle negates any tonal commotions and makes the operation of analysis increasingly efficient. Furthermore, the small stature of drones enables users to get close to the animals creating a panoramic view of the daily activities of wildlife. As most of the animals shy away from human presence, a stealthy approach will enable the researchers to uncover unknown behavioral patterns of animals.Real-time data wired from hovering drones can not only facilitate efficient monitoring practices but also provides supervision at the time of tracking injured and endangered animals. Additionally, national park security can be elevated with the application of surveillance, which comes from the integration of drones.Check Out: Top Drone technology CompaniesHow Is Drone Technology Leveling Up Construction Industries?‘Drones’ which are also referred to as Miniature Pilotless Aircraft, Flying Mini Robots are gradually growing in popularity. Although they are still in their infancy stage concerning its adoption by enterprises, it still has made a place in the industries. Drone technology is used for numerous reasons in the construction industry as well. It works as a tool that improves security, communication, and marketing and also captures real-time images from the field. The innovation can be applied to the construction industry in the following ways:1. Building Surveys: Most of the building surveys require the visibility of the building’s roof to identify its condition and assess any defect. Initially, pickers or ladders were required to get access to the roof which is both time-consuming and costly. Therefore, a small drone can be useful as it can save time, diminish any safety risks involved with surveying a roof or reaching out to places which are risky.2. Site Inspection: Construction site inspection can turn out to be dangerous and complicated at times. Drone footage can be recorded safely and then forwarded to the stakeholders. Site inspection can be done at regular intervals, can cover large areas more efficiently and reduces the risk factors and can save time as well.3. Health and Safety Inductions: Site inductions can be a tedious and time-consuming procedure. Using a drone to fly over a site can show new health and safety risks in real-time. It also enables site managers to demonstrate moving cranes, moving vehicles, excavation areas, etc.4. Maintenance Inspections: Maintenance inspections of high-up structures like bridges, towers, roofs involve costly arrangements and site personnel working at height. Here drones can play a significant role by providing real-time footage to the engineer by reducing cost and most importantly risk.5. Project Report: Progress reports of the construction sites are prepared monthly to examine the progress of the particular project. The reports include photographs of various parts of the construction site. With the use of aerial shots and HD video, stakeholders can gain a better insight into the progress.6. Promotional Photography: Impressive and unique pictures have become an essential part of construction enterprises to promote their business. The art of taking pictures from different angles can provide exciting sights of the building thereby helping estate agents to put forward powerful shots of the building they are looking to sell.7. Thermal Imaging Recording: Drones can be used to take aerial thermal imaging recordings which can detect the cold spots in the building and even the heat spots in areas holding electrical components. This can be helpful for engineers in having access to information when they are identifying and rectifying building defects.Check Also: Top Drone Professional Service CompaniesSee How ML Aids in Detecting Uncertified DronesCommercial drone applications are becoming increasingly customary, with recent forecasts indicating that drones represent increased market opportunities. Drones are extensively used, for newsgathering and inspection and mapping in industrial applications. In many cases, drones are required to transmit video feeds to their flight controllers imposing heavy uplink traffic load on the networks. Mobile networks are well suited to support drone communication, but this massive imposition demands mobile networks to identify if a User Equipment (UE) is a drone or a regular ground UE. But there may be an occurrence of uncertified use of mobile devices or subscriptions which may cause increased interference to the network. Interference mitigation techniques must be initiated, as soon as an uncertified drone is detected. Machine Learning (ML) is the key to Uncertified Aerial UE Detection. Read on!The radio link features and mobility patterns are different for aerial and ground UE. The device in the sky is expected to have a close to the line of sight propagation that leads to the low discrepancy of Reference Signals Received Powers (RSRP) of the active cells. For indoor UEs, the penetration loss will be more in comparison to an aerial UE at a similar height, enabling the differentiate the two UE types. As ML algorithms need data to be prepared the measurement data from known legitimate drone UEs flying in the network, are collected in addition to the data from ground UEs. The gathered measurement data are then divided, into a training data set and test data set. The former is used for training a drone detection machine learning model and latter for assessing the performance of the model. The detection accuracy increases with drone height and more measurement reports.Deploying machine learning algorithms in mobile networks for detecting uncertified drones is another challenge. Two options possible are a central entity storing all the data and training a single machine learning model or machine learning model being trained per cell or group of cells. Careful design is needed to strike the right balance between the amount of signaling between the nodes and uncertified drone detection performance.----https://cioapplications.com/ — Official Account of CIO Applications.

But just consider, for a moment, that just fifteen years ago we didn’t have Google Maps, Uber, AirBnB, Deliveroo and Spotify.They’ve all fundamentally changed how the entire world travels, works and consumes — be it food or content — from the ground up.I think it’s fair to say that the same changes are yet to be fully realised here in financial services. But there’s no shortage of forward-thinking firms who want to do better — and here at Seccl, we’ve got a unique vantage point from which to watch them work.On the one hand, we support entrepreneurial financial planners, wealth advisers and investment managers; those who want to use technology to build the efficient, client-centric firms of the future.And on the other, we power the disruptive, game-changing fintechs and wealthtechs, on a mission to make financial advice and investments accessible to everybody, regardless of their level of wealth. Taken together, they make for a pretty vibrant ecosystem, that we’re immensely proud to be a part of.It’s in that spirit that we recently kicked off the first of a soon-to-be regular series of meet-ups, where we’ll bring together senior technologists — who’ve been there and done that — with some of the most exciting tech talent in the UK today.We’ll explore some of the major topics that define businesses working with financial services today. And where better to start than to explore what a high-performance team looks like — and how to create one.So, over a few beers, some posh pizza, and an epic cast whose views I’m supremely grateful for, we explored the key ingredients of a scalable business. I learned a load, and thought it’d be worth sharing their thoughts here, too.Alternate your dev team between ‘farming’ and ‘mining’ roles — the former to tackle day-to-day customer and ops issues; the latter to concentrate on feature development…Create squads of no more than ten. Beyond that, accountability drifts and motivation fades…Up to your first 100 people, you need people who just love what they do and are in it for the career, not just the day-job. Beyond that you have to evolve your model…You can’t outsource culture. Don’t create a ‘two-team’ approach by outsourcing to ‘offshore’ teams. Instead bring remote developers into your business as fully bought-in employees. And think carefully about time zones…In short…the tech challenges are the easy ones. It’s people and culture that count…We started, as all frank conversations do, with the F word. Focus.It’s one of the challenges that most successful businesses will invariably face on their scale-up journey. How do you make sure you’re taking care of business as usual, while preserving enough resource to pursue opportunities that are further out on the horizon?The team at Octopus Energy have been grappling with this conundrum over the last few years. From a standing start a little over four years ago, the company has surged to around 1.2 million customers and well over £1 billion of annual revenue.‘My colleague in operations has a team of 500’, said co-founder and CTO James Eddison. ‘I’ve got 20. That’s 20 people to tackle the edge cases that 1.2 million customers inevitably create, all the while developing new features and products.‘We can’t let our customers down, but we also can’t waste the insight that they generate. So, to make sure we get the balance right, we alternate the team between two roles — “farming” and “mining”.‘When you go down the mine, you’re cut off from the world. You’re free from distraction, but with a real deadline and a pressure to deliver. It’s a great development space for new feature work.‘When you’re farming, you’re up in the sunshine tackling day-to-day problems — with all the distractions but also the diversity that it brings.’By alternating between mining projects (where three people are given a particular problem to solve over three to six weeks) and farming work (where they get to experience the issues that operations staff and customers face), the team has been able to get the best of both worlds.They can tackle the immediate needs of today’s customers; better understand the demands of tomorrow’s in the process; and ensure they have enough time and energy carved out to meet them — all at the same time. Miners and farmers, united in productivity.On the subject of productivity, how best to stimulate it?‘A pet theory of mine is that any tech project that’s more than three people for more than three months is going to fail’, James suggested.And it’s a principle that the business carries through into its customer-facing operation, too — with small customer squads of 10 people, each responsible for around 70,000 customers and a few million pounds of turnover. Customers get dedicated support. Employees get more responsibility and room to develop.Simon Jones, COO of mobile-first financial planner Multiply, agreed that small teams are best.‘We’ve just reorganised our whole team into squads of six people. We’ve seen a real sense of ownership develop as a result: a very clear objective that everyone is driving towards, and a real sense of achievement when you get there.’Finally, Penfold, the newly-launched pension for the self-employed, has just begun experimenting with OKRs to help translate its mission into reality. It’s certainly a super helpful framework that we like to use within Octopus as a whole, not to mention here in Seccl.But as teams grow, there’s no doubt that the productivity puzzle becomes all the more complex.‘At ten people, you just need to like what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it. You won’t have real problems until you’re around ten times that size.’That’s the view of one MD at a large global asset manager, who joined us for the evening.One of the big inflexion points that any company goes through, he says, is when your company starts to hire those who just want a day job, rather than those who are totally bought into it as a ‘career’.‘Not everyone wants a career — some people just want a job. And you’ll always need those people to do the important work that they do. But the challenges of hiring and management are just so different at this point.’It’s also then that the demand for so-called ‘10x engineers’ — or, to explain, the superstar developers who can do the work of 10 people — begins to wane. ‘It starts to get hard to give them the space to roam and rip up the rulebook.’David Harvey, Co-head here at Seccl, agrees. ‘Just look at a football team. A starting line-up of the 11 best players in the world, often won’t succeed.‘In high-performance teams, there’s a really important role for those who have one task, get on with it, and do it really, really well.’Scale also invariably throws in another element of complexity: geography.David Genn, CEO of Goji Investments, has recently started to hire remote teams ‘to get access to a broader talent pool, while trying to maintain our culture. We’ve found hiring developers in London to be really difficult.’It’s a topic that Georgia Stewart, CEO of pension transparency and shareholder engagement company Tumelo, approaches from a different angle. Based in Bristol, the company certainly has access to a cheaper talent pool than London, but has to break down the perception that it’s somehow for those on a more ‘chilled out’ career track.Our friendly MD and some great insight to share here to — particularly on managing a global workforce. ‘The maximum time zone difference you can reasonably support between teams is about 5 hours. If there’s 3 or 4 hours of overlap, that’s optimal. But a gap of, say, London and San Francisco… forget it.’‘And by the way, I don’t like the term offshore’, he added. ‘It implies a construct that is just not true. They’re just not here, that’s all. The reason I say that is that all of our developers are permanent employees. We generally don’t outsource — because you can’t outsource culture.’True as that is, what if you’re looking to inject some new vigour into your existing culture?That’s exactly the journey that Barclays is on. Its Eagle Labs helps individuals, businesses and corporates to innovate and grow, by providing incubator and accelerator space in former bank branches.But as Dane Scott from Barclays Ventures told us, the cultural exchange is two-way. ‘As well as housing new talent, we’re trying to hire remote teams, and actually learn new things and take on new cultural elements in doing so.’With a history dating back more than 300 years, and the complications of a global employee base of around 80,000, it’s not hard to imagine how innovation can be difficult. So, while perhaps it can’t be outsourced, perhaps culture can be insourced?Kane Harrison, CEO of Wombat, is familiar with the arrangement, as his company is currently on the NatWest Entrepreneur Accelerator Cohort. His increasingly popular thematic investing app (where you can choose to invest in particular trends or categories that interest you) is growing at a rapid rate — so if his experience is anything to go by, Barclays are surely on to a winner…Well, the quote of the evening for me was this: ‘The challenges we’ve spoken about — none of them are technical. Technology’s the easy bit. It’s all about people and culture.’ Amen.We’ll be planning our next meet-up soon, so let me know if you’d like to attend.A big thanks to Chris Eastwood from Penfold, Dane Scott from Barclays Ventures, David Genn from Goji, David Harvey from Seccl, Georgia Stewart from Tumelo, Gustavo Silva from Rosecut, James Eddison from Octopus Energy, Kane Harrison from Wombat, Simon Jones from Multiply.----I have spent time in recruitment, accounting, M&A, product & innovation.

However, since the summer of 2017, I have been a developer advocate.In this story, I want to tell you how I moved to this position, why I chose this path, and what I do to improve in this field.Have you ever felt that doing the job you used to enjoy doesn’t make you feel satisfied any more? I bet many of you have. They say that for a software developer it’s okay to change jobs every 2 - 3 years.I had been working at JetBrains as a YouTrack (browser-based bug tracker) software developer for 4 to 5 years when I realized that I wasn’t happy at work. I was tired of programming, though I thought before that it was what I wanted to do for a living.Fortunately, I understood that my problem was just a lack of satisfaction. I didn’t feel satisfied or that I was entirely using my potential when doing numerous tasks and fixing endless bugs day after day. I didn’t see my impact on the team’s results.At that point, I started switching to other activities, related to YouTrack. I helped to write docs and to process feedback. We decided to organize a public webinar devoted to the updated YouTrack workflow API. I took a very active part in it and even started a small community in Slack while preparing examples.Believe me, I felt happy and content those days and was way more productive than a couple of months before. So I’m very grateful to my manager, who allowed me to quit product development and to continue these community-related activities.It took me some time to find a proper job title. The range of my activities was wide and fell into different “usual” jobs:I don’t remember how I found this “developer advocate” job title, but I liked it immediately, though the term is still a little bit unclear today. One may think that developer advocates do the same as technical evangelists but without religious associations. For me, these two jobs are different.Technical evangelists work on turning everyone to their belief in the product; in other words, they engage new users in the product.Developer advocates work with those who are already involved with the product. They help external developers use the programmable abilities of the product and advocate their needs before the team.I’m not good at convincing people. However, I’m good at helping them.Over the last 1.5 years, I formulated the list of essential developer advocate skills. If you already are a developer advocate or are thinking about becoming one, you need to have them.You can’t do without them, as they’re your bread and butter. You need to know how to use them for sure.Even though most people outside your team are capable of reading the documentation, what you need is the following:What I do:As you are a developer advocate, you need to speak one language with developers. Or, as it is in my case, many languages. Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, C# - these are some of the languages our customers use to access the YouTrack REST API.What I do:I consider writing blog posts and tutorials to be the most reliable and convenient way to help the community. Some may prefer video content.However, making good videos requires a lot of time and effort, plus it is very costly to update them as soon as your software interface changes.Written content is faster to create and cheaper to maintain, meaning that you provide more information in a given amount of time.What I do:This subject is something I do not have much to say about at the moment. Developer advocates often participate in conferences and other events, and public speaking skills are essential for them.As for me, right now I have a 6-month-old baby, work part-time from home and won’t be able to attend any events for another half a year at the very least. As soon as I start making talks, I will write another story about it.In conclusion, I believe that three components make great developer advocates:If you have them, then I wish you a great walk on your yellow brick road to developer advocacy!----2We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/newsDeveloper advocate @Neuromation, needlewoman, blogger, momMariya DavydovainWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--13TKinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--132Preethi KasireddyinWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--111Mariya DavydovainWe’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alex Mathers--227Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120James Michael Sama--29HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Mariya Davydova,https://medium.com/@mariyadavydova,"8, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*HOs5B_SLWeeBRG5bBXOf_Q.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*sS5JfyFvptcxTFgho4EC5A.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*RmRzVpCHG_NRQ1o6wQMwzA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ZXixptvL4rzkx3EDuj38xw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ofMfrqFMfpaTH_RMvI_RQA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Pgc74KXDuVMZGrhjl3PyOA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*VFG8VLq4CWG2e8mDPx3gkQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*x1IbWRbPZ2bGtDjsFB872A.jpeg",5,346

We started small — a half day in SF with our five largest LPs, which also included our LPAC (effectively our board). It was really one of the first times we’ve had all of our largest investors in the same room, providing a forum for honest review, discussion, and feedback. We learned a lot, both from a strategic perspective for the firm, and also a logistics perspective on how to plan and run a more formal annual meeting.Note that the deck was last updated in October of 2018, and we’ve redacted a bit of company sensitive information, but for the most part that’s it in it’s full glory ;-) We hope this may be helpful to other VCs that are thinking about running annual meetings for the first time (it was hard to find good examples of decks), and most importantly we hope this may be useful for founders that are considering working with us and want to understand the latest iterations in our strategy.Our plan is indeed to make the Notation annual meeting just that, and to share it publicly with our community at large going forward.

Currently, it has an SDK for both Android and iOS. The SDK contains ready-to-use APIs for the following features:Today, we’ll explore how to use the Style Transfer API in React Native.I was only able to develop and test in Android (no Macs here!) and got a working application.The Style Transfer API styles images or video according to real art masterpieces. There are 11 pre-trained artwork styles, including Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Munch’s Scream, among others.The app we’ll be developing allows the user to take a picture and convert it into a styled image. It will also allow the user to pick the artwork style they wish to use on the image.The app will contain a Home page, where the user can pick the art style. It will also include a separate Camera View, where the user captures the image.Note: The following tutorial is for the Android platform only.Since there is no default React Native module for Fritz, we’ll need to write our own. Writing a native module means writing real native code to use on one or both platforms.To create the app, run the following command in the terminal:Move into the root of the folder to begin configuration.For navigation, we’ll be using React Navigation and React Native Camera for the Camera View.To install both dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:Follow the instructions here to configure React Navigation for the app. We’ll need to install react-native-gesture-handler as well, as it’s a dependency of React Navigation.Follow the instructions here to configure the React Native Camera for the app. We can stop at step 6, as for this example we will not be using text, face, or barcode recognition.First, we need to create a Fritz account and a new project.From the Project overview, click on Add to Android to include the SDK for the Android platform. We’ll need to include an App Name and the Application ID. The Application ID can be found in android/app/build.gradle, inside the tag defaultConfig.Upon registering the app, we need to add the following lines in android/build.gradle:Afterward, include the dependency in the android/app/build.gradle:We’ll need to update the AndroidManifest.xml file to give the app permission to use the Internet and register the Fritz service:We then need to include the following method within the MainActivity.java:Since the SDK only supports iOS and Android, we’ll need to make the native module. To get a better understanding of this, refer to the docs here:facebook.github.ioTo make an Android Native module, we’ll need to make two new files. They will be within the root package of the Android source folder.The React method being used has a success and error callback. The chosen artwork style and a base64 of the original image are sent to the method. The error callback is invoked when an Exception is thrown and returns the error. The success callback returns a base64 encoded string of the converted image. On a high-level, the above code does the following:This class is used to register the package so it can be called in the JavaScript side of the app.This class is also initialized in the getPackages() of MainApplication.java:Now on to the JavaScript side of the application.To do this, we’ll be creating/updating the following pages:This page contains:The page currently looks like this;The CameraContainer page displays a full page CameraView. It includes a button to take the picture at the bottom of the page. Upon clicking it, a spinner will be displayed to convey to the user that an action is taking place.The image is first captured using the react-native-camera method takePictureAsync(). The original image is then saved into the state of the page. The setState method is asynchronous and thus has a success callback that runs after the state is set.The getNewImage method from the FritzModule is run within this success callback. The original image and the filter (artwork style) picked from the Home Page is passed to the method. On the error callback, an alert is displayed to the user to convey that an error has occurred. On the success callback, the new styled image is saved into the state.

Indeed, with the rapid densification of certain urban zones across North America, the demand for the property management industry has been growing. According to IBISWorld’s Market Research Report, the property management industry in Canada draws revenue of approximately $7 billion, and has seen annual growth of 3.3% between 2014–19.While seasoned managers have come across just about every issue out there, and have employed creative methods to address them, it’s no secret that systems can be improved. Residents of properties have issues that need to be dealt with constantly; often, those issues don’t come at convenient times or involve convenient solutions for work schedules. To better improve the process of managing resident issues and provide accessible multi-lingual support, it’s time that property managers implemented new tools to assist the process.The experience of residents is greatly affected by the reception and response to a problem or need. The method of communication and immediate engagement on issues concerning a property or associated amenity is a critical area that should be improved with better, more reliable access directly from the areas most trafficked by residents within their buildings. By using smarter tools to digitize the process and triage requests more intelligently, property managers can allow themselves the benefits of efficient prioritization, easy digital recordkeeping, quicker facilities bookings, and effortless multi-lingual engagement.The good news for property managers is that they don’t need to look far for a product that not only provides these benefits, but packs in additional features that cater to the individual needs of each property, its manager, and/or its residents; the product is called ActiVue. Olivewood Software Inc has developed this new digital, fully customizable self-service kiosk to support property managers and residents in whatever their needs might be. ActiVue allows users to book facilities, view documents, access strata bylaws, report infractions, request renovations, report common area repair needs, pay fees, or simply write a message to a building manager.With built-in multilingual support, this system allows residents to quickly report issues and receive the service they require. The system also allows property managers to better sort through the important work that needs human attention while the tech handles the simple administrative and user-facing tasks. The system is deployed in a convenient kiosk that can be securely mounted in a foyer, mailroom or lobby. It bears repeating that Olivewood is dedicated to working with customers to ensure that ActiVue is built to support whatever unique needs exist for the residents of each building. You shouldn’t have to work just to accommodate new technology.There’s no denying that technology is here to help manage real world expectations. According to Forbes, technology-led property management solutions are growing rapidly, with artificial intelligence (AI) being the next step for the property management industry. Another article, again by Forbes, talks about how the adoption of technology into the property management industry is inevitable as it allows property managers to eliminate mundane tasks from their schedules and provide more service while using less of their own resources.Like all other business owners, property managers can be reluctant to prioritize spending resources on learning new technologies and managing technological upgrades over other business needs, but with the current rate of growth in the real estate market, the need for technological support is only going to increase. A system like ActiVue, that is built to your building’s needs and budget, can help your property management services run more effectively and offer a modern, responsive experience to the residents of the buildings you manage. Fill out this form to learn more about ActiVue and how it can be implemented within your buildings.Connect with us: https://www.olivewood.io----Leading provider of software outsourcing services and custom software development.Olivewood Software Inc.--Olivewood Software Inc.----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Olivewood Software Inc.,https://medium.com/@communications_1243,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*B31j49NspahJg9abdsmkdg.jpeg",3,0

The growing popularity of these products among the young generation is expected to drive the market growth over next six years.The growing awareness of consuming safe, smokeless, and ashless tobacco is expected to propel the market growth. Furthermore, given that vaping is considered to be an effective method to quit smoking, as it is less toxic and creates vapor instead of smoke. The adoption of vaping devices is expected to increase, particularly among individuals willing to quit smoking or willing to smoke merely for recreation. Launch of new and innovative vaping devices is also anticipated to foster the adoption of these devices.While the rising concerns over conventional cigarettes among various age groups has boosted the demand for e-cigarettes. Several E-liquid flavors have also been launched in the market to cater to the changing preferences of individuals, thereby stimulating the market growth all over the world. However, e-cigarettes are often compared to conventional cigarettes and hence tend to attract criticism, a factor that is expected to restrain the market growth.Several agencies have been calling for setting standards for vaping devices in order to encourage people to opt for a safer alternative to smoking. Long-term studies undertaken by various medical associations have helped determine that e-cigarettes can be considered as a safer substitute to conventional cigarettes. However, several governments have banned the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes, which has hindered the adoption of these products.The market space comprises major tobacco companies that control a large share of the global market. These players have forayed into the e-cigarette space with new and innovative products under their brand name.

It is also noted in that opening paragraph that the App Store has become an exciting and vibrant ecosystem for millions of developers and more than a billion users. Apple’s stated policy is to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. According to Apple, therefore, every app is reviewed by experts and goes through a review process. The company emphasizes that the open web is always accessible to those who do not fit the App Store model.Section 4/2/6 in the guidelines states that:4.2.6 Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app’s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients and should offer tools that let their clients create customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences. Another acceptable option for template providers is to create a single binary to host all client content in an aggregated or “picker” model, for example as a restaurant finder app with separate customized entries or pages for each client restaurant, or as an event app with separate entries for each client event.Apple has held a policy of Intellectual Property (IP) protection and a “do not clone” regulation in the past, but highlighting the issue in the design section of the guidelines, in addition to the Intellectual Property rules, demonstrates that the company is determined to maintain the App Store quality level and adhere to IP regulations, as well as to send a clear and more determined message about removing apps that don’t follow those guidelines.The rule set by the company led to the deletion of many white-label apps from the App Store, including many government apps. The move raises the question of whether this result is in line with Apple’s responsibility to its users and whether a better balance can be achieved in this regard.Apple’s responsibility to its usersThe App Store is a manifestation of the platform in the latest sense. It allows developers of all kinds to develop targeted and specific products and services without building them from scratch, using a shared infrastructure.App Store users are divided into two main types: end-users who download and use apps and developers who upload the apps to the store (after successfully passing the review process).Since there is no state-level relevant regulation (and perhaps there should be such), Apple is acting as its own regulator. Using its set of rules for its app developers’ community, it seeks to ensure that the App Store meets three standards — Trust, Safety, and Security. This is the responsibility that Apple has assumed for its two types of users, as part of maintaining its quality and reputation. I think we all can agree there is an excellent value in maintaining these standards and that they serve the users well.Also, to protect the IP of apps developers and ensure fair competition, Apple prohibits uploading apps that include code pieces that repeat existing ones in other apps. The rules for safeguarding and protecting fair competition appear in the sections dealing with copycats (4.1), the sections dealing with IP (5.2), and section 4.2.6, which was mentioned earlier. Since the rules in question came into effect, many apps that share code with other apps have been removed from the App Store.The tensionIn the name of protecting the fair competition in the App Store large marketplace, Apple has implemented substantial internal regulation that has created many externalities. For example, the regulations harm applications belonging to government agencies at various levels, which use the services of development companies that use a code infrastructure, making it difficult for them to provide tailored services to their citizens.Significant tension has been created between wanting to ensure fair competition, protecting IP and fighting clones, and wanting to allow as many public players as possible to take part in this virtual marketplace.On the one hand, there is no doubt that the App Store is indeed a sophisticated marketplace, which requires a set of fair competition rules and IP protection. Without such regulations, app developers will be hesitant to upload apps to the App Store for fear of being copied. It seems that user feedback mechanisms cannot adequately address this need, and therefore there is room for its regulation. Moreover, as Apple points out, being a part of the App Store is a privilege and not a right. Anyone who doesn’t find the rules to their liking can develop their app on the open web.On the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that the App Store has primarily become a public good for users and developers in recent years. The non-profit apps designed to provide services meet the economic definition of a public good, because they are both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. They rely on the fact that the App Store is a platform that makes it easy to reach millions of users with targeted apps that provide specific services, without developing code from scratch, but relying on existing commercial code infrastructures of various kinds.In my opinion, in balancing the tension presented, it is appropriate to favor the users’ benefit as a compass for determining the optimal balance. We must ask ourselves what will best serve the users and how to increase public benefit in the long run. In my view, when it comes to non-profit apps designed to provide services to the public, the benefit the public receives from the high availability of such targeted services outweighs the benefit in enforcing fair competition rules. The public and Apple, too, have a vested interest in allowing these services to be continuously developed, even if it harms fair competition, precisely because these are apps that are essentially public goods.Possible solutionConsidering the balance point I mentioned, I think it makes sense to allow non-profit public entities to upload apps that provide services to citizens to the App Store, even if those apps are already using existing code infrastructures that are already in use. I believe the reuse of code should be banned in the case of commercial, for-profit apps. You can make sure that only non-profit public apps are treated like that by managing a list of public entities, such as government organizations at all levels, that can be associated with a developer’s account. Commercial entities of this type will be required to adhere to the standard rules of fair competition when it comes to app development for the App Store. In this way, Apple will increase public utility from the App Store, while “violating” fair competition rules in a proportional and justified means.----yaron bendavid--yaron bendavid--yaron bendavid--yaron bendavid--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Christina SainUX Planet--64Alex Mathers--227Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",yaron bendavid,https://medium.com/@bendavid.yaron,0,5,0

The complex term is actually not that difficult to understand. We’re here to explain unified communications in the most palatable manner.Gone are the days when just plain old telephones were sufficient for business communication. If you run your business voice communication through an IP connection, then you have heard of cloud-based services that handle your entire communication and data.Coming to UCaaS, it is a service model where a company, like Tata Communications, provide a seamless telecom unified communication software or service that works on the global IP network. Usually, large organizations who have offices and clients worldwide need to deploy unified communications.Is it a part of SaaS?Well, it won’t be wrong to say that Unified Communications (UCaaS) is a sub-category of software as a service (SaaS). You will be surprised to know that the demand for UCaaS and other SaaS is increasing at an unbelievable rate. There are several reasons for this increased demand, one being the convenience that it comes with, followed by the seamless and effortless network setup. Imagine, if communications go down, all you have to do is call your unified communications company.What all forms a part of UCaaS?The offering by unified communications companies could leave a business spoilt for choice. Typically the offerings come as a package. They may include messaging tools, encryption of messages, video conferencing tools, renounces to support unified communication (voice and video) and more. It is upon the business to choose the one that suits their needs. If you’ve just started, then you might go with the single-tenant system.The unified communication model is extremely flexible, and that’s what is the most appealing quality of it. You can scale or downscale it, depending on your business situation.What are its benefits?User experience:Of course, when you allow a unified communications company to manage your business’ communication, then the experience is going to be seamless and boast-worthy. Therefore, those who have already deployed UCaaS, highly recommend it.Cost-effective:Because you avail a package from your UCaaS partner, the whole deal doesn’t burn a big hole in your pocket. If you were to set up the entire system by yourself, it would not only be a hassle some process, but would also require more money.Less friction, higher productivity:When you’re speaking to a client based out of a different continent, you can’t afford a lagging communication network. UCaaS ensures a seamless experience, thus, leading to lesser friction. Since there is barely any downtime, the productivity of the employees also tends to be higher with UCaaS.Collaboration:If you work in a collaborative manner, where screens are shared, workshops are conducted over the net; then you may want to go with UCaaS. Unified communications and collaboration are known to go along well together.Final thoughts…UCaaS is the upcoming business communication model. So, it’s best that you deploy it at the earliest and make the most of it.----Sharvi ahuja--Sharvi ahuja--Sharvi ahuja--Sharvi ahuja--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alex Mathers--227Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Sharvi ahuja,https://medium.com/,0,2,0

& Mineral,Shoya ImaiFollow--ShareSAKE、日本酒が世界酒になるための展望を技術的側面から整理しました。三軒茶屋醸造所にて、2019年の年初に《FONIA SALT prototype 〜花酛〜recipe no.015》という“ボタニカルSAKE（米と麹を中心としつつ、植物由来素材を発酵副原料に取り入れたSAKE）”を醸造しました。すでに蔵内在庫は完売ですが、このお酒の設計から連なる世界醸造の挑戦に向けた伏線の話をまずさせていただきます。FONIA SALT prototype〜花酛〜 recipe no.015博物学リンネ三界の《鉱物界（mineral）》との調和を目指した第一作。モチーフは「花酛×ゴーゼ」。諸国ドブロク宝典に記述のある岩手の民間どぶろく製法《花酛》を採用し「西洋唐花草（ホップ）」を酛立てに使用。沖縄海塩4種と庄内藻塩で発酵促進しつつ旨味とコクを引き出し、鳥海高原ヨーグルトと山形産ドライフルーツで香味を調え、最後にドライホッピング。塩と乳酸菌を発酵に用いるビールスタイル《ゴーゼ》との融合です。上槽後無濾過のため原料由来の澱がございます。塩が与える生命現象への不可思議をご体感ください。醸造年度：平成30酒造年度製造年月日：H31/2/22（醸造期間：H31/1/17〜2/18、上槽2/19〜2/21）原料米：出羽燦々（山形県産）、つや姫（山形県産）精米歩合：麹米70%、掛米70％副原料：ホップ、塩（沖縄海塩・庄内藻塩）、ヨーグルト、ドライフルーツ（ピオーネ・シャインマスカット・すもも）使用酵母：協会6号酵母製造方法：花酛白麹天然塩二段仕込/Botanical/Non-Filteredアルコール分：14度「花酛（はなもと）」という言葉には馴染みのない方がほとんどだと思います。これは日本酒の歴史や技術に精通した方でもおそらく同様で、Google検索してもヒットしない文字列でもあります。これは、『諸国ドブロク宝典（1989年、農山漁村文化協会出版）』という日本各地の民間伝承製法をまとめた書物に登場する、どぶろく製法のひとつです。酒税法によって自家醸造が密造とされている現在では、禁書といってもいいかもしれません。僕の次兄が東京農大醸造科在籍時に都内で購入し、実家群馬に置いてあったものを、三軒茶屋醸造所創立の際に見つけ東京に再び持ってきたものです。どういう製法かというと、“唐花草（からはなそう）”という日本原産「山ホップ」の毬花を煮出し、その煮汁を仕込水として使用すると、どぶろくが美味しく造れるというものです。三軒茶屋醸造所では、多様なボタニカル（植物由来素材）を発酵に採用していますが、以前三軒茶屋で独自発案した《黒茶酛（=乳酸発酵した茶葉である「黒茶」を煮出し、その茶を仕込水として酛立てする酒母技術、recipe no.006）》に続く、発酵初期からボタニカルが関与する好奇心をそそる製法だったため、ぜひやろうということでレシピに落とし込むことにしました。問題点として唐花草の入手が困難だったことから「西洋唐花草（＝ビールで用いるホップ）」で代用。塩と乳酸菌を一緒に発酵させるドイツのビールスタイル《ゴーゼ》を参考に、この2つを統合させて「花酛×ゴーゼ」をモチーフとした異なる文脈を融合したボタニカルSAKEとしてコンセプトを固めました。思えば、昨年2018年は史上初のボタニカルSAKE《FONIA（フォニア）》が本格的にリリースされた年であり、さらに夏には《WAKAZE三軒茶屋醸造所》が創立。そういった意味でも、2018年の自分の中での大きな発酵テーマは【Botanical】でした。では、その「BB(Before Botanical)/AB(After Botanical)の世界観」の次は何が来るのだろうと思案するなかで、2019のテーマを【Mineral】と決めました。medium.comMineral、つまり“塩”というテーマも非常に深いものがあり、文献を読み進めるほどに、世界各国の多様性やいまの日本酒に重なるような「工業化を強いられてきた歴史」を感じるようになりました。（例えば、明治期の国費調達のための「専売制」、昭和期の「塩業近代化臨時措置法」による塩田製塩法廃止、イオン交換樹脂皮膜製塩法による工場大量生産方式の採用など）。合理化の名のもと、各地の非合理とされる太古からの製塩文化の破壊が日本酒同様に進められたといえます。また、自然界を捉えていく上で、『博物学（Natural history、直訳で自然史）』という切り口が存在しますが（東洋における「本草学」）、その中でも自然界を分類する最も古い“界”の区切りは学名の命名法を考案したリンネによる三界、つまり【動物界】【植物界】【鉱物界】とされています。現在の学術的な界の分類・定義は、微生物の発見などに伴い、度重なる改修が進められていますが、人間の世界から見た自然界の分類は西洋においてもこの3つの区切りが素直で妥当な感覚だったということでしょう。以上の思案を深めていく中で、“調和”という意味を込めたFONIAシリーズが《自然界と微生物との調和》を意図するとしたときに、Botanicalの取組みとは、自然界を大きく分けた三界のひとつ【植物界】との調和を究める道筋であり、一方で、Mineralの取組みを行うことは、また異なる界である【鉱物界】にアクセスし紐解いていくことなのではないか、と感じるようになりました。そういった意味で、従来のFONIAシリーズ（和のボタニカル、世界の茶葉など）とは一線を画す《FONIA SALT》として、異なる発酵体系であることを明示しながらお酒の具現化を進めていきました。商品設計単体としても、花酛やゴーゼといった未知の挑戦によって充分意欲的な領域に踏み込むわけですが（実際、花酛の科学的合理性については先行研究がなく想像の域を出ない、ゴーゼの再現のためにヨーグルトなど禁じ手の素材すら採用）、仕込水にミネラル豊富な沖縄海塩（宮古島の雪塩など）を4種類ほど溶かし込むことで、《Mineral》への挑戦に大いなる伏線を込めました。つまり、世界醸造における「硬水条件の発酵体系」の技術訓練として経験を積もうとしたのです。（Mineralに連なるテーマとしては、これ以外にも「五味としての塩味」、「神棚へ祀る塩」、「身体との浸透圧」という切り口もありますが、それはまた別のお話としてお伝えできればと思います。）現代日本のここ100年くらいの酒造技術のベースには『軟水醸造法』という発酵体系が深く関わっています。そして、日本は軟水の国なので、「日本酒は軟水でこそ美味しいお酒が造られる」という認識が現代にはあります。しかしそれは歴史を遡ってみれば、わずか明治時代中期に端を発し、三浦仙三郎という広島の偉大な技術者が切り開き、体系化し（明治31/1898年「改醸法実践録」発刊）、その美酒による実績により全国に伝播した「軟水醸造法」登場以降のことです。それ以前の江戸の時代では、むしろ硬水寄りの“灘の宮水（みやみず）”で造られたお酒こそが至高とされ、『下り酒（上方から江戸へ下る価値のある酒）』として名を馳せ、熟成や海上輸送に堪えうる強い酒質で人々に愛されていました。下り酒以外の酒はむしろ「下らない酒（取るに足らない=“下らない”の語源）」という評価であり、田舎の不安定なお酒として大きな流通に乗ることは稀だったと思われます。その勢力図を技術の力で変革したのが「軟水醸造法」です。広島の挑戦の歴史に連なるように、三浦仙三郎の息子世代の新政酒造5代目佐藤卯兵衛（同世代に“マッサン”の竹鶴政孝）によって、《6号酵母（類まれな発酵力をもつ“清酒酵母”的性質を持つ原初の酵母）》が秋田で現出し（昭和5/1930年）、軟水かつ低温地域でも優れた酒質のお酒が本格的に国を挙げて造られるようになりました。軟水地域が圧倒的に多い日本において、この勢力図の変化は「日本酒は軟水でこそ美味しい酒が造られる=硬水では日本酒は造れない」という新しい世界観を生みました。この一連の歴史は、いわば「硬水仕込の常識」が「軟水仕込の常識」に置き換わったパラダイムシフトの瞬間でした。銘醸地の“拡大”をもたらした技術革新。僕らはこれをもう一度ひっくり返しにいこうと考えています。WAKAZEがイメージする日本酒が「世界酒」になったときの姿とは、SAKEが世界中で“飲まれる”だけでなく、SAKEが世界中で“造られる”ことだと捉えています。その何よりのハードルとなるのが、「硬水では美味しいお酒は造れない」という常識そのものです。造り手は自由に土地を選べず、軟水地域の中でお酒を造るか、硬水に大掛かりなフィルターを通し軟水化することでしかお酒が造れません（もちろん清潔な水であることは大前提ですが）。その常識を根幹からひっくり返し、硬水でもお酒が造れるという技術証明、いわば「硬水醸造法」を発酵体系/レシピとしてまとめ上げ、それを突破口として伝播することで、世界中の今までSAKEが造られなかった地域に銘醸地を拡大していく。これが日本酒が世界酒となるための“技術的道筋”と考えます。SAKEは、米という“穀物”から造られる醸造酒です。果実に対して圧倒的に優位な穀物の性質として、その「輸送性」が挙げられます。ジャンルを超えた大きな比較で見た場合には、水による「地域性（ミネラルや生酛などに必要な微生物の多様性）」と、穀物の「輸送性（アイデンティティの範囲内による選択）」が合わさるとき、SAKEの基本骨格の真価が発揮されるのではと考えます。三軒茶屋醸造所では、「地域の湧水」と「山形の米」による骨格で唯一無二のレシピを考案し続けています。その歴史的転換点の象徴の地として、食の都フランス・パリほど相応しい場所はないと思っています。何より、先人たちがすでに硬水で仕込める方法論は証明しています。江戸時代の宮水・下り酒、そして現代日本における超硬水仕込の尊敬する蔵。先輩たちの挑戦に比べたら、それほど難しいこととは捉えていません。今の日本は、新しい造り手を縛り、新しいレシピすらも縛る環境にあります（明治期から続く酒税法の免許制度など）。その中でWAKAZEは、多様性を志向し、樽熟成《ORBIA》やボタニカルSAKE《FONIA》という新しいアプローチを磨き、さらには海を超えた世界醸造を目指そうとしています。多様性という観点で見たときに、46億年の歴史を持つ地球と生命の進化がモデルとして参考になります。「全地球史アトラス（情報・システム研究機構国立遺伝学研究所と東京工業大学による、生命誕生や進化に関する最新研究仮説の映像作品）」によれば、生物進化は《地球との共進化》であり、以下の3つのパターンに分けられると考えられています（「カンブリア紀の生命大進化」など）。つまり、すべてを滅ぼしうるような厳しい環境変化に耐えたものが次の多様性を育み、大陸の動きによって生存地域を二分された種がそれぞれ独自の進化を遂げた後に、それらが再集合することで「多様性の爆発」が起きるということです。この枠組みを《多様性のグランドデザイン》の示唆として捉えるなら、多様性とは、一見劣悪に見える環境変化や、大陸間レベルの離合集散・交流によってもたらされるということが言えると思います。そして今、SAKEを取り巻く環境やWAKAZEの取り組みは、まさに2の段階にいるといえるのではないでしょうか。“日本酒”は海を超えて造られるべきです。また、いま現実として、それは止めようがない潮流として存在しています。WAKAZE以外の様々な造り手たちが、日本国外での醸造に情熱を燃やしています（明治41/1908年創業、海外最古の酒造会社ホノルル酒造＠ハワイ、を皮切りに）。現在、WAKAZEはフランス・パリでの酒蔵創立に向けて、クラウドファンディングを実施しています（2019.8.12まで）。お陰様で多くの方にご支援をいただき、当初目標額を大きく超える額となっております。改めて、フランスでの期待の高さに背筋が伸びる思いです。ご支援いただいた皆様、誠にありがとうございます。この海外醸造への挑戦は、WAKAZE創業前夜から代表・稲川たちと掲げてきた夢であり、この実現をできるかどうかもわからなかった僕の修行を受け入れてくださった多くの蔵への恩返しの第一歩でもあります。夢を掲げてからここまでの約4年間そのものもそうですが、今年2019年は特に目まぐるしい勢いで酒蔵の創立に向けた道を辿っています。www.makuake.com僕らがパリで造るSAKEの未来にある、世界中の硬水地域でできたお酒たちは、江戸へ「下り酒」を運んだ“樽廻船”の時代のように、熟成と輸送に耐える強い酒質によって軟水酒に優位性を持ち、「次世代の下り酒」として世界中を席巻することも充分有り得るかもしれません。レシピと技法と観察眼で四季や土地柄の変化に対応していた《職人の酒》たるSAKEは、国を超えたどんな環境であろうとも美味しいお酒を造ることができる、そういった「世界で一番自由な醸造酒」としての証明がこれからなされていくと思います。この職人の柔軟な姿勢こそが、100年単位の歴史に振り回されず、数千年単位の文化として日本酒が続き、これからも持続していく唯一の道であると考えています。技術を基盤として育まれる“SAKEの多様性”は、大陸を超えて再び技術交流を重ね、離合集散し、醸造酒・蒸留酒の区分すらも超えた文化交流と食のシーンとの融合の中で、地球上で“爆発的な進化”を遂げていくと信じています。ぜひ応援よろしくお願いいたします！パリで醸す初回醸造酒をお届け！WAKAZEが今年の夏パリに酒蔵を立ち上げる----1988年生まれ。WAKAZE共同創業者/杜氏/CTO。

I got the chance at interning at the place of my choice, learned a lot more than I had initially expected and made friends and mentors for a lifetime. Here is how my experience with Fyle panned out.I am Raghuveer, a Bangalorean with my roots deep-seated in Tamil Nadu. I’d like to believe that I am a stoic workaholic with a passion for travel photography and football. I graduate from Sir MVIT (Sir M. Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology) in a few months to come.How my journey as a developer startedIt was during my education that I figured what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I’ve always had a keen interest in tech and the startup life. In this vast and ever growing ecosystem, it was important for me to channel my energy towards achieving my personal and professional goals.In the pursuit of figuring out my career choices, I started exploring various domains such as Web Development, Mobile Application Development and so forth very early in my college days. This was the phase in my life where all my friends always complained that I was busy all the time. But, I was merely exploring. After a lot of failed attempts to learn EVERYTHING through online courses, I understood the value of an overall hands-on experience.I started developing small applications in parallel to learning about the language/framework. This helped me develop a firm grip and understanding of how things actually work. But, deep down I knew, the way things are done out there in the industry was definitely much more sophisticated.I still remember my first major team-work in my college days. We were asked to develop a web app for online registrations for our fest. Even though we were just getting used to the term “web app”, we agreed because we were getting two weeks off to do it (yay!).We did complete this in the said time and it was a major success. Ah, the feeling only developers can enjoy! This helped me truly understand what I loved doing.The start of my entrepreneurial journeyMy interest in web development peaked during my engineering days. I started off with a few web application development projects. Towards the start of my final year, my interests diverted to more technically challenging domains such as machine learning and AI. This was when I started looking for Backend/ML internships at B2B SaaS startups.It had just dawned on me, I had finally figured my domain of interest.During my college days, I always use to mention Fyle as an example of how an idea can change into a product. Little did I know, I will be a part of Fyle, myself!My experience with FyleIt’s been four months since I started at Fyle as an intern. I work on data-extraction, which involves Machine Learning (ML) data at large scale. This has been a very challenging experience for me, where everyday I would look forward to new problems to solve.The element of getting exposure to cutting edge techThere’s no denying that every techie wants to work on today’s cutting edge technology. I am fortunate to have gotten this opportunity at a very early stage in my career.Having extensively worked on ML/data at Fyle has given me the confidence to build on this skill set to become a technically skilled professional. The absolute freedom to explore and the undivided support at Fyle has enabled me to go on and gain what isn’t easy to achieve in this competitive world.What makes Fyle, FyleI absolutely love Fyle, to say the least.Even when I would have internals or seminars back at college, I would wait to finish up and run back to work. As an intern, I always felt welcome and a part of the family. This family is made up of two amazing founders and an energetic and vibrant team and loads of memories that keep us going.One of the key differentiators at Fyle is that everybody trusts you. Be it the founders or my colleagues, I have always been treated with the utmost trust. The freedom to work from home, also helps maintain a good work-life balance.This is the one place where you will always find team members who help uplift and motivate the entire team. Here, everyone is always happy to clear your doubts and help you if you’re stuck with something. This helps create a wholesome and inclusive culture, which helps both the interns and full-timers grow both professionally and personally.My career path with FyleEarlier this month I was also given a full-time offer. I was jubilant when they decided to retain me. Unable to hold back my excitement, I accepted the offer the very same day. Interning with Fyle seems like a dream career start for me. The exposure I got at Fyle was unmatched. During my internship I received the opportunity to understand how multiple sessions of brainstorming and ideation can turn into a viable product.Fyle empowered me as an intern and helped me to equip myself with the necessary professional and social skills needed in an entrepreneurial setup. Fyle is a dream opportunity for anyone who is determined and passionate about B2B SaaS. Now, I look forward to joining Fyle as a full-time employee!With Fyle, the best is definitely yet to come!My dreams and aspirationsIn my professional life, I have always wanted to work on cutting edge technologies which improve and streamline processes. Personally, I wish to travel the world, contribute to environmental conservation and capture it all through my lens. In the long run, I aspire to be happy.----1Computer Engineer | Travel Photographer | Sports EnthusiastThe PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alex Mathers--227Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--44Unbecoming--768HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Raghuveer P S,https://medium.com/@raghuveerps57,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*IHIlvhOPJ4yEZyJi-ncUmQ.jpeg",4,112

Be that as it may, few individuals consider how much assets individuals spend every year warming their home, carport or other room. In nations with virus winters this issue is much increasingly important. Tragically, the warming of premises and lodging isn’t constantly done in an earth agreeable way. For warming utilize an assortment of radiators and gas, electric radiators. These gadgets are not ecologically benevolent, and their cost is extensive.Presently in our reality a standout amongst the most vital issues is the warming of different premises and lodging. The fundamental wellsprings of warmth spend a great deal of assets, have a high value, staggering expense of hardware task, the quality does not coordinate the overrated cost, and this additionally badly affects individuals’ wellbeing. All individuals who live in mild or colder atmospheres pay a ton of cash for warming. The cost for this administration is high and keeps on developing each year. Associations and endeavors that give us this administration for all intents and purposes couldn’t care less about the earth and, when consuming fuel, produce a lot of unsafe substances into the air. Every one of these substances cause extraordinary harm to nature and our wellbeing.To tackle every one of the issues recorded above and give the world an ecologically well disposed warming strategy, the pros built up the Saiterm venture.The creators of the venture built up a warming framework called Spring. This is a totally new imaginative warming framework that is reasonable for warming a wide range of premises. The framework will be recognized by its effectiveness, usability, unwavering quality and above all natural amicability. Spring will be as sheltered as feasible for nature and human wellbeing.The thought struck a chord engineers from nature. After numerous long periods of research, specialists have arrived at the resolution that a standout amongst the most effective warming frameworks can be made utilizing sun oriented infrared beams. These beams are well-known to every one of us and don’t hurt human wellbeing and nature. This warming framework is currently protected and alluded to as Spring.Spring can be effectively and immediately coordinated into any private, business or different premises.

494,44247,https://medium.com/@johnukuku/becoming-a-web-developer-567f8b775900?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,BECOMING A WEB DEVELOPER,None,"JohnukukuFollow--ListenShareBecoming a web developer can be as challenging as working out every day. It can be as stressful as your first week in National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Camp ground.It’s important to know what it will take to succeed as a web developer. As an aspiring developer, I made some inquiries from senior colleagues in the field. Here are 6 things I learnt and decided to share with you to consider for aspiring web developers:1. The Right Attitude and BeliefThe first hurdle to get through is yourself. Let me explain:Why is it that some people in difficult situations manage to succeed and those who have ‘perfect’ upbringings sometimes end up in positions that don’t make sense at all?You don’t want to become a web developer.You want to become a successful web developer.(sounds cheesy, but it’s true).The next step after aligning your attitude to becoming a web developer is BELIEVING that you are one.You may be thinking, “but I don’t know enough to be called a web developer” or “but how can I be a web developer if I don’t know what a simple <p> tag is.?”These are valid questions… and I’m not saying you should lie about being a web developer or that you should take on work far beyond what you are able to do at this moment.What I am saying is that you need to “trick” your brain and boost your confidence in BELIEVING that you are a web developer rather than second guessing it. Try it and I can assure you that this method is far better than doubting the fact.If someone asks you, “so what do you do?” tell them without any doubts, “I’m a web developer/freelancer.”This may lead nowhere, but you’d be surprised how many people will be very interested in the fact that you are a web developer/freelancer. Almost as if you pulled some Star Wars Jedi mind trick on them.Whether you’d like to become a web developer or freelancer, your mind-set and attitude is crucial to your success. Frank Edward said in one of this tracks “What you said is who you are. If you believe, you will …’succeed’.”2. Determination and DisciplineFailure and doubt are inevitable. The question is how you will deal with it when it happens.You need to be determined, motivated and driven to really be successful at web development. There are many aspiring web developers out there. Not all of them will be determined and driven and motivated. Not all of them will be disciplined in learning web development. That might not sound right, but it is true.How bad do you want to be a web developer? The proof of desire is in Pursuit. We are all busy with other things and you may even have a full-time job while you learn web development (that’s in fact how I started).My stay in Learn Factory Nigeria as an Intern in Cohort 2.2 was a big deal. I had to sacrifice so much for 6 months. I was a Computer Engineering ND1 student in Abia State Polytechnic, Nigeria, when I joined Learn Factory. Laptop issues, Transport Fees, Data subscription, reporting to school and also reporting to Learn Factory simultaneously, unstable powers supply at home to practice, no source of income to run expenses, lecturers ‘palaba’ all in 6 months. It was not easy. But I had to do it to get what I want. Why? Because I have to be stronger than my excuses. I have to Pursue…overtake…and CONQUER my challenges to becoming a web developer.The hard part is not starting… it’s whether you keep going. You need to be disciplined in learning.Set a schedule and stick to it.I used to work from 8am-5pm, come home by 6:30pm to my parents, do home chores waiting for me, eat, relax for a bit, when there is power supply, I will start learning to code from 9:30 till the power will cut off. That was very challenging for me, but I needed to be highly focused and discipline for it to worked out well.Maybe you have children or other important priorities or challenges just like me, but don’t make excuses. If it’s important to you, you will make a plan to learn and you will force yourself to be disciplined.3. Stubbornness/PersistenceYou may be thinking, “why stubbornness?”It’s good to be stubborn or persistent as you learn.What I mean by that is if you have an error in your code or if it is not coming out how you’d planned and thought (which happens more often than you might think,) don’t just move on if you can’t find the solution and don’t cut any corners. Be stubborn and figure it out. You can leave if and relax your brains with other activities. Come back to that code. That error will be revealed. It worked for me a lot.Although it may take you longer to figure out, what you learn by being stubborn in this regard is that your knowledge will remain with you and you will be more efficient and effective in your future projects because of this.4. PrioritizingIf you want to do something great, it comes with sacrifice. This is challenging to accept for most people.If you want to be a great programmer or freelancer and you are complaining that you don’t have time, then just look at your daily/weekly/monthly routine to see what you can remove to free up more time so that you can learn more, develop your skills and apply what you know.One of the biggest distractions I’ve eliminated in my life while staying in Learn Factory Nigeria, are seeing movies, reduce Church activities, quit lectures and quitting my work. It was hard to do at first, but even if I got tons of movies in my hard disk, and colleagues that are movie freaks, who discuss trending series, I wouldn’t even be interested now.Whether you are a student, a full time employee, a husband/wife/father/mother, you need to know how to prioritize.Every single day there is around 140,000 websites added to the internet. Imagine… that’s almost 2 websites EVERY SECOND!So if you are interested in creating a website for your own business, it will be good to start!Do what you need to do, don’t neglect your family, cut out the TV, cut out distractions and learn how to code — after all, that is your goal so be serious about it and work towards it.5. The SkillsYou can’t become an accountant without understanding accountancy. The same principle applies for web development.In order to be a web developer, you need to know what web development is, how it works, the programming languages and their importance, what to learn, communication skills, problem solving, innovation and more.It’s important that you know how to learn effectively. To read more into this, I will recommend a link that will help you with that eBook.6. Your GoalsYou need to define your goals.WHY do you want to be a web developer/freelancer?Would you like to learn web development and apply for work and be an employee?Would you like to be a freelance web developer and work for yourself?When you create a website, what is your deadline?My colleagues especially Kayode, will always ask you “What is your Driving Force? “What motivates You?”Once you have your goals, make sure you are driven by it and focus on working towards achieving them. Don’t be like most people and set goals that fade away after a few months…How to set your goals in 5 simple steps?Be S.M.A.R.T (SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ATTAINABLE, REALISTIC, TIME-BOUND)  S — SPECIFIC: To become a freelance web developer M — MEASURABLE: I will measure my progress every month and set defined goals to reach my specific goal. A — ATTAINABLE: Challenging, but yes. R — REALISTIC: Definitely. T — TIME BOUND: 12 monthsOnce your main goal has been set, break down the 12 months into medium-term goals, in this case it would be:*Don’t worry if these terms are a bit technical for you.In 3 months, I want to know Frontend Web Development In 6 months, I want to know Backend Web Development In 9 months, I want to start working on my portfolio website, build my brand, improve on my business knowledge and perfect my web development skills. By 12 months, I want a portfolio of 5 websites, I want to be a full-stack web developer and I want to know the fundamentals of freelancing and gaining clients.Once I have my medium-term goals, I break it up into my monthly goals:Frontend Web Development Month 1 — *Learn HTML & CSS*Create a website using what you learnt * Month 2 — *Learn JavaScript *Create a website using what you learnt* Month 3 — *Learn React.js and React Native* Create an app using what you learnt*  Backend Web Development Month 4 –*Node.js and MongoDB* Create an app using what you learnt* Month 5 –*Learn GraphQL & Apollo* Create an app using what you learnt* Month 6 — *Learn Electron and Data Visual*Make a functional, dynamic website using all you have learnt so far  Portfolio, Personal Brand, Business Knowledge, Web Development Knowledge Month 7 — Create a personal portfolio website, social media profiles and build a personal brand Month 8 — Reach out to businesses & organizations to create websites for them Month 9 — Improve portfolio, web development skills and personal brand  Portfolio of 5 Websites, Full-Stack Web Developer, Freelance Fundamentals, Clients Month 10 — Must have a minimum of 5 websites on portfolio Month 11 — Learn freelance fundamentals and business essentials Month 12 — Reach out to prospective clients, promote your work and get clientsNow that you have your monthly goals, break it down into daily goals:You don’t need to study full-time to make this goal a reality — this would help for sure, but if you are working and you can only study part-time that is also fine. If you can dedicate 3–4 hours every day to this schedule, I fully believe that you can accomplish this goal if you are dedicated, disciplined and motivated enough.This is just a very short example and a simplified guideline, and it is not intended to be a comprehensive goal-breakdown, I just want to illustrate how it could be done. The programming languages mentioned above are just examples too.Write out your goals, print it out and stick to it.One of THE MOST important aspects of achieving your goal is:ACCOUNTABILITYIf you are accountable to someone and you have weekly/monthly calls to discuss the progress and he/she holds you accountable and motivates you when you feel like giving up or have any doubts, it will push you through and help you stay focused. The more honest and ‘hard-core’ your accountability partner is; the better!I had an accountability partner and Team Leader, O.G when I started freelancing, and it was crucial in playing a major part in my freelancing success today.Last, but not least… TAKE ACTION, adapt and stop making excuses.Until next time,John Emmanuel .U. +234- 8171524657 @Johnukuku----JohnukukuinLearnFactory Nigeria--JohnukukuinLearnFactory Nigeria--JohnukukuinLearnFactory Nigeria--Johnukuku--Stephen AdesinainLevel Up Coding--29Reed BargerinWeb Dev Hero--2Christina SainUX Planet--64The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Philosophical Techie--14Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Johnukuku,https://medium.com/@johnukuku,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jM6evOxXKL8UBlPcCmRm6g.jpeg",8,6

499,321,https://medium.com/@parismarx/is-apples-cash-cow-in-trouble-9215f813ee8b?source=tag_archive---------23-----------------------,Is Apple’s Cash Cow In Trouble?,Reality distortion field in full swing over iPhone slowdown,"Paris MarxFollow--5ListenShareYesterday, trading of Apple’s stock was briefly paused for CEO Tim Cook to deliver some bad, but not wholly unexpected, news: revenue in Q1 2019 would fall far short of expectations, in large part due to slow iPhone sales. Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR, XS, and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected, and now that’s been confirmed.When Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers, it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue, in particular, so much lower than expected?In Cook’s letter to investors, he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets, in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years, and now the issues with Apple’s product line are coming back to bite it.Any slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted for nearly 63 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters, Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless.In explaining the lower iPhone revenues, Cook blames lower carrier subsidies, a stronger US dollar, and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company in an interview with CNBC when it was actually a response to a massive scandal over slowing down batteries in older iPhones.While these things may have contributed to lower sales, they miss the bigger challenge that Apple is facing with the iPhone line, and the way Cook completely ignores it in his letter illustrates how the reality distortion field is still in full swing among Apple executives, and could ultimately be hindering them from addressing the real problem.In that same interview with CNBC, Cook says that carrier are offering lower subsidies, so for customers who have been out of the market for two to three years and are returning to get a new phone, everything looks more expensive. Except phones don’t just look more expensive, they are more expensive.Apple has been slowly increasing the price of iPhones for years, to the point where the cheapest of its new models now costs $749, but there are also base models for $999 and $1099 — higher prices are a trend across the whole product line. These prices are in large part a response to the significant decline in iPhone sales growth as the smartphone markets in the United States and China has become saturated. Since sales growth has stalled, average selling price needs to increase to keep overall revenue growing — but even that seems to be becoming a challenge.Despite the issues cited in China, Cook says all-time revenue records were set in the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. The company has stopped reporting sales numbers, but it’s safe to assume this is a result of higher revenue from its premium phones — the iPhone XS and XS Max — not due to selling many more phones over last year.Apple is the iPhone. Sure, its other product lines are doing well, but none comes nearly as close to matching the size and importance to Apple’s bottom line. The company has so far avoided its reckoning with the state of the smartphone market by raising prices, but that strategy is already catching up to it. Even though Cook placed the blame elsewhere, there can be no doubt that higher iPhone prices are a contributing factor to the slowdown; it’s getting harder and harder to justify an upgrade, and raising prices again isn’t going to make it any easier.----5Critic of tech futures and host of Tech Won’t Save Us: https://bit.ly/twsuParis Marx--119Paris MarxinRadical Urbanist--7Paris Marx--3Paris MarxinRadical Urbanist--133umair haqueinEudaimonia and Co--56Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Neeramitra ReddyinIn Fitness And In Health--21The Good Men ProjectinHello, Love--266HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Paris Marx,https://medium.com/@parismarx,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*zZfypGS8gIVvgyjrxkFKRw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*95PpmJtBYPeyTJkn09tTcA.gif",4,139

Why is it not widely used by healthcare professionals?Everybody talks about big data in healthcare — and no wonder. Data is the very basis of all medical decision making. In recent years, technological advancements have produced new giant data sources like genomic testing and wearables.The new data is much needed in medical care. The current patient data — such as pain levels or quality of life — has previously been gathered in-office, and documented in the EHR by clinicians or nurses. This means the data has been lagged and episodic in nature: we’ve only gathered data on the patients’ well-being when they’ve come for a check-up or fallen ill. This kind of data also has problems with reliability. Studies show, for instance, that clinicians systematically rate pain levels as lower than patients do.The modern patient data is captured by wearables or patient-reporting apps. This kind of data gives clinicians more accurate knowledge on how the patients are doing everyday life, even when outside the healthcare facility. The new data enable physicians to investigate trends over time and gain new insights into individual baselines and their variation — another core value promise of this data.The modern data holds great promise for personalization. For instance, measuring a genetic and behavioral risk scores would shed light on the most significant health risks — which the patient and clinician could then together focus on tackling. This would enhance prevention, as health interventions could be better targeted.However, there’s a huge gap. Modern patient data is currently used mostly by consumers to track their activity levels or sleep, but almost none of it is not used in medical decision-making. Clearly this new data holds a lot of promise. So what is stopping us from taking it into clinical use?There are a few main reasons for this.To take modern patient data into clinical practice requires research and innovation — both from technological and medical professionals. Narrowing the gap between consumer data and clinicians is worth striving for, as in this data lies the promise for more patient-centric and personal medicine.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204402/----Notions on healthcare and the human condition.Anni Karjala--Anni Karjala--Anni Karjala--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zach QuinninPipeline: Your Data Engineering Resource--15Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Anni Karjala,https://medium.com/,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*H6lNg9EiyHQSetGC_Vf8rQ.jpeg",3,2
507,48979,https://medium.com/@thojackson40/top-telecommunication-technology-news-c473c803e3d4?source=tag_archive---------184-----------------------,Top Telecommunication Technology News:,None,"Technology MagazineFollow--ListenShareThe telecommunication industry has already seen sweeping technological advancements. On top of it, the Internet of Things is also making an impression on the industry. IoT is going to make communication even more safe and efficient than it is at the moment. These effects that IoT is going to have on the telecommunication industry will subsequently get translated into benefits for the industries that depend on the telecommunication industry and for individuals as well.Check This Out: Facilitating Developments in the Telecommunication Sector with IoTThe developments in the telecommunications are happening at a rapid pace, propelled by technologies like optical fiber, cloud, and 5G, in addition to IoT. The extent of these developments is so vast that experts are finding it difficult to predict where the market is, headed. The improving services have reduced rates for customers while increasing revenues for the service providers. Businesses can now base many of their processes on networking and make the most of improved connectivity. They are also able to iron out delays, enhance efficiencies and improve customer satisfaction.Although the horizons look full of possibilities, the challenges are also a part of the plot. Several things can go wrong as a result of the growing technologies. The networks are expanding and growing dispersed. To manage these technologies, when they spread over large areas, becomes difficult, and the need to use sophisticated machines will increase. Service providers will require more processing capacities and growing intelligence. While security is a pertinent issue that most users of telecommunication industry face, hackers can access all the devices connected to the internet and cause data leaks and cyber attacks. With a vast amount of sensitive data available on the internet, data security becomes a significant concern. IoT-enabled applications require a hundred percent uptime.Telecommunication act as a facilitator in many industries and hence, developments trickle down to those industries as well. The future holds significant possibilities of growth courtesy of IoT in telecommunications. Healthy competition among the telecommunication companies can maximize the benefits and reduce the challenges to make them non-existent.2. What are the Latest Trends in the Telecommunication Industry:The year 2019 is crucial for every industry due to the rapid advancement in technology as every organization is trying to keep up with it. Similarly, the telcos are also feeling the pressure of making investments in technology while focusing on developing business models that will cater to 5G and other opportunities.“Intelligent Connectivity has facilitated the convergence of high-speed 5G network”Once 5G is available in the market, it will create significant revenue-generating opportunities not only in the broadband and business-to-business areas but also in smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT) and connected homes. The biggest challenge will be to realign businesses and revenue models to support the new service.Here are some of the top telco trends predicted to shape the sector.1. Accelerating Cloud AdoptionTelecommunication companies are influencing the scale and agility of cloud that virtualizes the networks by rapidly introducing innovation and embracing IoT opportunities. The prospectus includes investment in cloud platforms and cloud-based unified commercial services.In the upcoming years, it is expected that cloud will become increasingly embedded in the business process as the telecommunication sector will struggle to manage and automate their omnichannel interactions with the customers and take the support of big data to generate revenue opportunities.2. 5G gets RealMost of the sectors like energy, transport, manufacturing, healthcare, and transport are ready to seize the potential provided by 5G and IoT technologies. The advancement of 5G will help the telecommunication companies to partner with other providers so that they can capture the market opportunities. The major market prospects for the telecom sector will be fleet management, data collection and analytics, blockchain, smart city technologies, and predictive maintenance.5G can create a wide range of opportunities in various fields, starting from machine-to-machine service and autonomous vehicles to remote healthcare and innovative video delivery services. Telco also has to invest in technologies for creating a go-to-market model that will capture the 5G-IoT businesses.3. Ecosystem Value CreationTo take full advantage of the IoT opportunities, the telecommunication companies have to do more than making an API to the IoT platform available. They have to flawlessly create an ecosystem where the independent partners can together create value along with facilitating sophisticated integration capabilities and secure exchange of data.Moreover, to enable virtual monetization schemes that will support automated service delivery, the telecom companies must adapt the process of handling complex and extended customer value chain.4. Privacy and Digital IdentityIn the coming years, privacy and identity theft will become a critical issue for providers. In an era, where data security is directly linked with customer satisfaction, the telecom industry’s capability to provide greater visibility and control of personal data in exchange with personalized service will win more customers.Medium: CIOReview----Technology Magazine--Technology Magazine--Technology Magazine--Technology Magazine--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Technology Magazine,https://medium.com/,2,4,0

Policy has a crucial role to play, but ultimately it is businesses that will make the energy transition happen. In Energiewende home country Germany, many start-ups are at the forefront of transformation by bringing novel business ideas to market and by snatching market share from incumbents in sectors such as renewables, heating or mobility. In areas like storage and hydrogen, the young companies in this “Green Energy Valley” are among the world’s leaders and could be key to cleaning up polluting industries. Incumbents also bet on start-up innovation to cut emissions, and the government now nurtures the sector with a plethora of support programmes. But many start-ups continue to lament overburdening red tape, hesitant investors and a relatively small domestic market that slows expansion.The energy transition’s spread into transport, industry and heating, as well as the rapidly rising share of renewable electricity in many countries around the globe, put a new spotlight on the importance of innovation for the projects’ success. Countless new solutions are required to decarbonise all sectors of the economy, and in many cases, it is start-ups that can offer this.In energy transition pioneer Germany, both the government and large corporations increasingly bet on a vibrant “green” start-up scene when it comes to reconciling the shift to renewables with economic success — some call the country a “Green Energy Valley.” Thanks to their innovative capacity and an irreverent approach, start-ups are both boon and bane for established companies and sectors — they can bring new ideas into staid businesses, but also disrupt entire industries.“We need to challenge conventional paradigms,” said Christoph Frei, secretary general and CEO of the World Energy Council (WEC). “That’s exactly what the start-ups are about. They deliver this kind of ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking and the necessary attitude. They have no fear of reinventing everything,” Frei told Clean Energy Wire.The speed of energy transition innovations, often led by start-ups, continues to exceed expectations — witness the dramatic cost reductions in PV solar and battery storage, which have been crucial for their current rapid deployment around the globe.According to Germany’s environment ministry, around two-thirds of all “green” basic innovations can be traced back to founder companies. “Without the relevant green start-ups, the renewable power sector wouldn’t have developed the way it did,” environment minister Svenja Schulze commented in a survey of the scene.Start-ups play a crucial role in the success of the energy transition, and also in the economy as a whole. According to research conducted by the Borderstep Institute, “they have created far in excess of one million jobs in Germany over the last ten years.”“Germany has a key role to play. The mere fact that the term ’Energiewende‘ has become a globalised word speaks for itself. If people want to understand what an energy transition could possibly mean, they still look to Germany for what could go wrong, and also for what could go right. Germany has examples to offer for both.” — Christoph Frei, CEO at World Energy CouncilEstimates of the number of green start-ups in Germany vary wildly between around 6,000 and several tens of thousands, depending on the definitions used. Around a quarter of all start-ups classify themselves as green because they contribute to sustainability. Of these, around one in ten works in energy or electricity, and around one in 15 in mobility or cars. [See the Factsheet Germany’s green start-up scene in numbers for more details, and the dossier Germany’s Energiewende start-ups — Cutting emissions as a business model for a collection of start-up profiles and interviews.]A total of around 4.6 billion euros were invested in German start-ups in 2018, more than ever before, according to business consultancy EY. In this respect, Germany ranks second in Europe behind the UK (7.2 billion euros). But only a fraction of that money went to German start-ups directly engaged in the energy transition: 407 million euros were invested in mobility start-ups (an increase of almost 40 percent versus 2017) and 99 million euros in energy start-ups (plus 15 percent). Much larger sums went into e-commerce (almost 1.7 billion euros), financial technology (fintech), and software (around 700 million euros each).Innovation experts say that Germany’s example is still vital for the progress of the global energy transition, even if inadequate government action in recent years has meant the country has fallen back in the worldwide race towards decarbonisation.“Germany has a key role to play,” argued Frei. “The mere fact that the term ’Energiewende‘ has become a globalised word speaks for itself […] If people want to understand what an energy transition could possibly mean, they still look to Germany for what could go wrong, and also for what could go right. Germany has examples to offer for both.”“Owing to the political framework of the energy transition, there is continuing interest in seeing whether Germany will succeed, and how,” Borderstep’s founder and director Klaus Fichter told the Clean Energy Wire. “Additionally, Germany continues to be renowned for its engineering prowess and technical knowledge, which also generates a lot of interest in the developments in the energy sector.”With reference to global start-up hub Silicon Valley, Fichter argued that Germany has become a “Green Energy Valley” thanks to the strong presence of start-ups focusing on making the economy more sustainable. This status is also reflected in British bank HSBC’s ranking of the countries’ potential to decarbonise, where Germany comes first, thanks in part to “a particularly large cleantech industry” creating many business opportunities related to the low-carbon transition.The energy transition in Germany has now entered a new stage, and is seeping into parts of the economy where decarbonisation has barely begun in earnest so far, such as transport and heavy industries. At the same time, the rising share of intermittent renewable power has put the focus on the question of how to store renewable power — and many German start-ups are at the cutting edge of these endeavours.Their activities are key to shaping the energy transition “megatrends”: decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitalisation. [See our dossiers Digitalisation ignites new phase in the energy transition, Electricity storage is next feat for Germany’s energy transition, and Battered utilities take on start-ups in innovation race for background and plenty of examples for start-up activity.]“Particularly strong are storage technologies and hydrogen — and energy conversion more generally — meaning power-to-gas, power-to-liquid, and so on,” said Fichter.International rankings reflect the strength of German start-ups in general, and their leading role in the above lines of business in particular.For example, the San Francisco-based Cleantech Group compiles an annual Global Cleantech 100 list to show “which types of companies are most likely to have big commercial impact in a 5–10 year timeframe,” and which “represent the most innovative and promising ideas in cleantech and are best positioned to solve tomorrow’s clean technology challenges.”Ten German start-ups made it onto the current Cleantech list: energy storage companies Electrochaea, Skeleton Technologies and Sonnen; fuel cell and hydrogen specialists Hydrogenious Technologies and Sunfire; energy efficiency specialists Kiwigrid, tado and Thermondo; as well as air taxi innovator Lilium. Even more start-ups on the list hailed from the US (47) and Canada (12).Sunfire and Hydrogenious are the only start-ups on the list focusing on hydrogen, and from a total of 11 companies active in “energy storage” three are German.A few years ago, German start-ups were also leading in PV technologies, but the sector has collapsed as production moved to Asia — a timely reminder that the ground can shift quickly in this sector, which is not only sensitive to economic trends but also highly susceptible to regulatory changes. As it turned out, Germany’s solar industry did not manage to wean itself off generous support payments [For more details, read the dossier Stricken solar sector sets out to regain leading Energiewende role.]The fate of Germany’s PV sector is also a timely reminder that many start-ups fail before they can have any impact. According to an oft-cited study conducted by US researchers Startup Genome, around 90 percent of start-ups fail, while other studies have found that little more than half survive to their fourth year.According to a report compiled by business consultancy KPMG on German start-ups, around half of all start-up founders had already established another company earlier. “Quite a few start-ups are the result of founders who have already experienced a failure,” the report stated. “Failure is, therefore, a central issue in entrepreneurship.”Sören Amelang is a staff Correspondent for Clean Energy Wire.

Esse é a primeira parte.Estive a frente de uma equipe técnica nos últimos anos. Depois que as coisas estavam mais ‘azeitadas’, passei a pesquisar metodologias para lidar diretamente com as pessoas.Sempre senti falta de um contato mais presencial com os membros da equipe enquanto era subordinado de outras lideranças (e bem no fim até hoje é assim).Em minhas pesquisas, várias teorias da Administração saltaram aos olhos, pois querendo ou não ainda se notam várias abordagens como as do Taylor acerca da visão para com o ‘chão de fábrica’. ‘O pensamento não pode partir do funcionário’… bom, estamos falando do cara que inventou o papel de Gerente.Ora bolas, também não vou crucificar o sujeito. Várias outras citações dele ainda são observadas…, mas é óbvio que devemos demais a sujeitos como Taylor, como ao Ford (que introduziu um baita pavimento para o que foi construído nas décadas seguintes), e principalmente ao Fayol, que estipulou um alicerce mais firme sobre as teorias.Enxergo os três como os pais do modelo(monstro) que perdura até os dias atuais.Mas conforme as décadas foram passando, tivemos uma inversão monstra nas perspectivas ao percebermos que por exemplo, a internet trouxe um dinamismo nunca sonhado.Se o mais audacioso dos sonhadores dissesse em meados dos anos 90 que teríamos a quantidade de dispositivos atualmente conectada, tenho certeza de que teriam escrachado o sujeito… Claro que existem ressalvas como o nosso querido Moore que disse que os transistores processariam a cada 18 meses o dobro pelo mesmo preço anterior, ou ainda o próprio Isaac Asimov, que antes da década de 70 já sonhava com ‘bibliotecas centralizadas’, e ‘conhecimento compartilhado’. Caras assim são exceção. Conseguimos identificar 1 e outro a cada 20 anos.E chegamos por fim ao século XXI… que como o Stephen Hawking bem comentou, é o século da complexidade. E esse pensamento encorajou outros autores a pensarem na complexidade no ambiente empresarial, como o adorável Jurgen, que juntou muito conteúdo num compendium chamado de Management 3.0.Já falei disso em outros textos: É cômodo a Gestores e Diretores tomarem decisões as vezes baseadas no humor que eles tinham quando saíram da cama logo pela manhã. Mas decisões que impactam o destino e as vezes a sobrevivência de instituições legadas precisam ser tomadas com um pouco mais de carinho…, e um dos fatores a serem considerados e reconsiderados quantas vezes forem necessários são os colaboradores.É literalmente parar de pensar no colaborador como o ‘cara do chão de fábrica’, pois estes ‘pestinhas’ sustentam as instituições e são responsáveis pelo desenrolar das coisas…Pois bem:Muito se discute sobre a 4ª revolução industrial.VAMOS COLOCAR SENSORES EM TUDO QUANTO É CANTO, E VAI SER MUITO MASSA!!!E vai mesmo. Eu concordo. Eu adoro a perspectiva de que os wearables vão cada vez mais nos ajudar. Sou também um dos defensores do uso de A.I para o que der na telha.‘AH DOUGLAS MAS OS ROBOS VÃO ROUBAR SEU EMPREGO’.Tomara.Me poupe não estou reclamando, as coisas se transformam caro leitor.Porém… a T.I evoluí num ritmo louco. E isso gera até um certo receio nas instituições, principalmente nas empresas de tecnologia. Trabalhamos com gerações diferentes de colaboradores, e o mercado em si se modificou bastante. Não vamos exagerar as coisas ao ponto Black Mirror, mas que as coisas estão se transformando e exigindo um dinamismo diferente a fim de consolidar espaço de mercado, não mais apenas pautado por preço ou capacidade de divulgação e venda de produtos(mkt), isso estão.Recomendo bastante o curso da Alura sobre gestão de pessoas 4.0, ministrado pelo Enio Moraes, e também a leitura e participação nas atividades propostas pelo Management 3.0.Até a próxima!----College Teacher at @FaculdadeMaterDei.

510,56923,https://medium.com/google-cloud/cloud-tasks-is-a-little-stateful-7ef39aad7d00?source=tag_archive---------38-----------------------,Cloud Tasks is a little stateful,Applying “Stateful” to a Queue?,"Adam RossFollowGoogle Cloud - Community--ListenShareServerless products like Cloud Run are intended to host stateless services, allowing amazing horizontal scaling. External services like Firestore and Cloud Storage are often used to bring “state” back into the picture. In this post I’ll explore how Cloud Tasks can bring bits of statefulness to your application architecture for those use cases where a queueing system can help.In this post I’m using the newly GA’d Cloud Tasks HTTP Targets, which allows each task you create to be configured for delivery to a web service. For a more general introduction to Cloud Tasks, go read Asynchronous Code Execution with Google Cloud Tasks then come back.The premise of a queuing system is that information goes in, and eventually disappears when the work is done. Before explaining in more detail how this applies in Cloud Tasks, let’s talk definitions:From Wikipedia and TechTarget:a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system.While Cloud Tasks is not going to indefinitely remember preceding events, it does remember data from these events after they have otherwise been discarded by stateless components of the system, such as your Cloud Function or Cloud Run service. Let’s explore how Cloud Tasks uses this otherwise forgotten information.In Cloud Tasks, you create a task which represents a bit of work to be done later at a pace determined by the configuration of a particular queue. Each task can carry unique properties which propagates details of the current request into the queue. This allows you to skip storing the data of this work item in a database.When you create a task, you are defining an HTTPS request which will be dispatched to a handler which processes the request. That handler can pull anything out of the HTTP request, and use that to look up data in other systems.At a minimum, every HTTP Targets task needs a URL for dispatch of the task. Of course, a URL can include arbitrary path and query string components as one mechanism to carry some data. Beyond that, the HTTP Method and Body can be overridden, and arbitrary HTTP headers added to the request. Here’s an example of using gcloud to create a task with a customized query string for “search parameters” and a slightly more subtle header to carry a user ID.Instead of storing a request object to a database, the key details of this request are stored on the task. On the other hand, the key account details for user123 are kept private and looked up by ID as-needed.Once the task is created, dispatch will depend on how the queue is configured, the performance of the handlers at the other end of the URL, and how successful processing is generally. Until the task is completed, you can inspect its details to confirm it has the HTTP properties you expect, and check on how delivery is going.You can check on the delivery details of a task using the gcloud or the API. gcloud has a handy command which leverages the Cloud Tasks API to get the task object:In these details we see Cloud Tasks has attempted delivery 9 times, and is getting an HTTP status code of 405. It will keep trying (depending on your configuration up to 30 days) until it gets a 2xx response code.In this case it looks like the task handler is not expecting the Cloud Tasks default of using HTTP POST requests. There’s no task update option, so the options are to change the handler service to support POST or delete and recreate the task.Let’s try recreating the task using the GET method:Trying that same describe command again, we see the task no longer exists, and the error from the API shows it’s gone:If we try describing our new task, we might see it’s already been processed:This means we can request the task details and use the response to answer many questions, including:You may not want to use Cloud Tasks in lieu of a status field in your database since the “completion” message will disappear.When you create a task, you can set a schedule-time property to have your task delivered up to 30 days in the future. This means your front-line services can keep adding work even during maintenance periods for backend systems.The task IDs thrown around in some of the commands above are pretty numerical, but as the developer you can specify an ID unique to your queue. If it’s unique, it will be the only ID you need to deal with.If it’s not, Cloud Tasks will helpfully send back an error. You might think, GREAT another error to handle; however, this is a fantastic feature. It means you can implement a circuit breaker around the creation of asynchronous workloads.For example, suppose you have a Content Management System which needs to update a sitemap at the end of any 24 hour period that had any content update. You don’t want to build the sitemap if there’s no change, and you don’t want to build it more than once.Using Cloud Tasks deduplication and scheduling features, you can easily build a “trip-line” mechanism that will run your job at 2am if at least one content update has been made:In this post we’ve seen many ways that Cloud Tasks can provide little bits of application state that serverless apps might need for success:To walk through an example of using Cloud Tasks to transmit state to an asynchronous workload, check out the postcard tutorial in the Cloud Tasks docs.----Google Cloud - CommunityEngineer, Developer Relations @ Google CloudAdam Ross--Harsh ManvarinGoogle Cloud - Community--Daniel SancheinGoogle Cloud - Community--96Sandeep DineshinGoogle Cloud - Community--69The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Love SharmainDev Genius--10Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267aruva - empowering ideas--52Jacob BennettinLevel Up Coding--51HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Adam Ross,https://medium.com/@grayside,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*p0QC_M4YlQ9rNzz5D03QAw.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*kfVN8hPDeznoR7bMTsPTXA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FKi9W7KNBL4Ok3NII8lgVA.png",6,13

In the essay below, Hannah Ridenour, research manager, discusses the goal of research and evaluation at the CMA, and reviews the ARTLENS Gallery NEA study and tool kit.These are just some of the questions museum evaluators employ in pursuit of supporting outstanding museum experiences for visitors of all ages. The Cleveland Museum of Art’s Department of Research and Evaluation strives to better understand the visitor experience by conducting numerous projects and studies every year.In 2016 we were fortunate to receive a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to analyze the overall impact of digital interactives on museumgoers. Evaluating something as complex as the benefits of interactive technology in art museums is no small feat, so the department partnered with Rockman et al, a research, evaluation, and consulting group based in San Francisco and Bloomington, Indiana, to embark on a two-year study that ended in 2018.The CMA’s ARTLENS Gallery first opened in 2012 and underwent a major reinstallation in 2017. This interactive space is designed to help visitors look closer, dive deeper, and have fun discovering the museum’s collection. As a space dedicated to using technology to engage visitors with art in new ways, it was the ideal location to undertake our NEA impact study.The project goals centered around uncovering layers of insights pertaining to a series of interrelated topics: the effect of digital interactives on a visitor’s relationship with the museum and its collection, how certain audiences interact with ARTLENS Gallery, what value the technology brings to visitor engagement, and how to best measure engagement and impact.The first few months of the project (begun in 2017) involved organizing discussions with CMA staff in the interpretation and digital innovation departments about the goals of ARTLENS Gallery, researching how other museums had attempted to tackle related topics, and assessing the best ways to learn from visitors while meeting the specific objectives of our study. After testing our questions, rating scales, and methodologies, we began our final data-collection phase in late 2017. Thanks to the more than 400 participants who completed pre- and post-visit surveys over three months, we were able to capture and compare their perceptions, motivations, and expectations between when they entered and left the museum. Not all participants chose to include ARTLENS Gallery in their visit, enabling our team to understand not only how ARTLENS Gallery visitors feel about the CMA but also how going to different spaces in the museum changes the visitor experience.We then began several months of data analysis and reporting. It’s an exciting moment when an assumption is proven in the data, and it was amazing to discover evidence of changing perceptions and thoughts over just a single museum visit, hinting at the impact that is possible over even longer periods of time.Perhaps the biggest discovery was that participants who spent time in ARTLENS Gallery were able to report greater gains in art understanding and knowledge than those who did not.Since art museums provide so many different opportunities for learning, we wanted to gauge how a type of experience like ARTLENS Gallery — one not typically expected in an art museum — effects those opportunities. We also were eager to examine if there was a noticeable connection between a visitor’s comfort level in an art museum and their perceived level of knowledge. We were delighted to find that even though ARTLENS Gallery visitors, on average, started their day feeling slightly less comfortable in their sense of art comprehension, visiting ARTLENS Gallery in combination with other areas of the CMA — such as the collection galleries or special exhibitions — led to greater increases in their art understanding and knowledge. The following graphic illustrates this enlightening finding.Furthermore, ARTLENS Gallery visitors were also more likely to feel entertained as a part of their visit, have fun, and pivot to thinking of art museums as places to expect new experiences. Some effects we measured were even stronger among young adults and those with children who engaged with ARTLENS Gallery. And the majority of ARTLENS Gallery visitors who participated in the study could attribute the following positive outcomes to their time spent in the digital interactive space:Taking an increased interest in the museum’s collectionFeeling encouraged to look closely at art and notice new thingsBeing guided to artworks of personal interestLearning new skills for viewing or interpreting artworksThrough its digital interactives and games, ARTLENS Gallery offers tools to connect with art in personal and unique ways. The newest iteration of ArtLens Exhibition — an experiential space within ARTLENS Gallery that puts the viewer into conversation with masterpieces of art — fittingly examines the theme “What Can Art Be?” by engaging and familiarizing visitors with the CMA’s collection. Whether you have yet to visit the Cleveland Museum of Art or do so often, start your next visit with the ARTLENS Gallery and you’ll see art through a whole new lens.Using ARTLENS Gallery as a test site, the museum’s NEA impact study was designed for evaluating digital interactives at any art museum, and we hope the metrics we established, the findings the study generated, and the questions it continues to spark will benefit visitors at all museums. The white paper summarizing additional findings from this two-year project, Art Museums and Technology: Developing New Metrics to Measure Visitor Engagement, is available on the CMA website along with a tool kit for museum evaluators to begin studying the larger impact of interactives at their organizations.This blog is the fourth in a series highlighting the new installation of ArtLens Exhibition.

514,31410,https://medium.com/doctors-in-tech/python-basics-2-variables-and-types-1ebf240acec7?source=tag_archive---------93-----------------------,Python Basics 2 — Variables and Types,This is a part of a python tutorial series based around medical examples to teach healthcare professionals how to code in Python.,"Dr. Matt, MBBS BScFollowDoctors in Tech--1ListenShareA basic concept in programming is variables and their type. In some languages you have to explicitly declare a variables type, this means that variable can only be of that type, and not change. This has some advantages, but can effect the speed of development and overcomplicate learning a language, especially at this stage.Fortunately, Python is not one of these languages. You’ve already seen one type and used it in your programme. This is a string. This is a simple type. There are other simple types; Numbers (integers/floating point) and Booleans.Strings are effectively characters. They are declared using a single or double quotation mark. It doesn’t matter which one you use, although, using double quotations will allow you to use apostrophes. This is because if you used single quotation marks, and apostrophe is the same character and therefore would end the string early. Storing a string in a variable is as simple as follows:A single equals sign (=) is an assignment operator. The variable, myString, is assigned the value ‘This is my string’.There are two types of numbers that we are going to discuss here, integers and floating point numbers.An integer is just a number, without a decimal component. An integer can be as long as you want in python, up until your computer runs out of memory.An integer is defined as follows.A floating point number is a number including a decimal point. Floats are often used when a greater degree of accuracy is needed.A floating point number can be declared in the following 2 ways, the second way is known as casting:Booleans are a very simple type. You can think of them as binary, true or false. They have many use cases, and are often used to decide if a condition is met or not. Assignment is very easy.Simple operators can be performed on variables. Operators are symbols that tell Python to perform a mathematical task.To combine two strings you can do the following.This will print to the console.You can use any operator with integers and floating points as below.This will print to the console the following. Try it for yourself.NOTE: # in python declares a comment, this just means on that line any text following the # is ignored. You can use them in your code to tell other people why you are doing what you are doing. This is good practice.It is possible to combine numbers within a string, however, in order to do this we need to ‘cast’ the number into a string. Casting is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. You have seen this process before using float() to create a floating point number from an integer. Type the following into your console:If you have done this correctly, this will print to the console.Wrapping age in the cast str() converts the integer 30 into a string “30”. Now that these are the same type. It is possible to append the number to the string (as you are actually combining two strings). If we did not cast the variable, then the code would not run, and you would get something called a ‘type error’.Other useful casts can be found here.You have learnt basic types in Python. These are the basis of all of your programs. More complex types are built from these simple types, which we will discuss in more detail in the next tutorial.For this weeks challenge we are going to combine everything you’ve learnt so far.You have a patient, Jane Dow, who takes 10mg of propranolol 4 times a day. Begin with the following code:You should write code that prints out the following to the console:Make sure you use the variables whenever necessary so that if you changed a value the phrase would print out appropriately with the new information.The solution will be posted at the bottom of the next tutorial.Good luck!Follow us on Twitter and Facebook.----1Doctors in TechMedical Doctor | Medical Technology | Neurology | Published Researcher | While I have your attention, you may as well scroll down.Dr. Matt, MBBS BScinDoctors in Tech--3Dr. Matt, MBBS BScinDoctors in Tech--1Dr. Matt, MBBS BScinDoctors in Tech--2Dr. Matt, MBBS BSc--2The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--126Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--174Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech","Dr. Matt, MBBS BSc",https://medium.com/@thedevdoctor,1,4,5

It helps us in tracking and logging user activity across the application.If you are using spring data jpa, the task of maintaining the audit log becomes very easy since spring-data-jpa provides an efficient mechanism of achieving automatic auditing of entities. I am using a basic spring boot application to demonstrate how to achieve it.I have created a class named Person which has fields like name, age, and gender. We want to store audit information like created date, last updated date, created by and last modified by of this entity. We can add the required columns in the same entity or can keep the auditing info in another class which all your other entities can extend.First, we will add logging of created and modified dates which is pretty straight-forward. We can use @CreatedDate annotation for tracking created date, and @LastModifiedDate for tracking updated date. It takes the current system time and to store these values.Next, we will implement created by and modified by for our entities. JPA can analyze createdDate and lastModifiedDate using current system time but how to tell JPA the author name for the changes.In order for JPA to know about the currently logged-in user, we need to provide an implementation of AuditorAware and override getCurrentAuditor() method of the same. Then we can add the logic to fetch the currently logged in user. If you are using spring security you can get the currently logged in user from the security context principal object.Next step is to enable auditing in our configurations. We can achieve that by annotating our configuration class with @EnableJpaAuditing. Then we need to create a bean of type AuditAware which will return our AuditAwareImpl instance. The name of the bean is passed to the auditorAwareRef argument of @EnableJpaAuditing to specify the implementation class.Once the configuration is done we are all set to leverage the auditing functionality provided by spring data jpa. The final entity will have audit columns like this:You can find a sample project for this implementation at Github.----3Manika Singh--2Manika Singh--2--2Milos ZivkovicinLevel Up Coding--Larry | Peng YanginMastering Java--Ivan Franchin--Panos ZafeiropoulosinDev Genius--2David Marko--Greg L.

Origin story, mission story, product story, opportunity story... You tell stories to yourself, your friends and family, co-founders, teammates, customers, investors, and press. Here’s a simple thought experiment extracted from fiction writing to help you tell the story about a future changed by the existence of your product or service.A good science fiction story can be reduced down to a simple framing.“Imagine a world where…”The quality of the work a writer does to realize a world determines the quality of the story and experience of the audience. What’s the difference between that world and the one we live in now? What happens to the people who live in that other world? What are the greatest challenges they may face? What new possibilities become reality?Here are a few examples.The same concept works well when considering startup ideas.Counterintuitively with startups, the more unbelievable the story premise, the more potentially successful it will be if it works. Transformational, disruptive ideas will often seem terrible until reality proves that they’re not.Interestingly, you don’t always need to sell big cultural or economic transformation to the first users of your product. Uber needed only to convince people that they could push a button and get a ride to take them where they wanted to go. Airbnb needed only to convince people that they could rent a space where they needed to be. The best story to tell is the one that inspires the action you want people to take.You can use this thought experiment to inspire a creative mindset to frame your idea and the resulting consequences to write a compelling story to share when recruiting, fundraising, and selling. What story are you telling?Thanks to Sahil Lavingia for the conversation which inspired this story. He’s the founder of Gumroad, a profitable startup that makes it easy for creators to sell their work. He escaped Silicon Valley and lived to tell the tale, now as an artist and writer in Utah.

523,2828,https://medium.com/@eric.bott/the-mice-96a04aec70b0?source=tag_archive---------132-----------------------,The Mice,Today I make a confession.,"Frederick BottFollow--2ListenShareIf ever I did something that I thought I might go to hell for, one day, something that more than 40 years later I am still deeply ashamed of when I remember it, this is one.The reason I am writing about it now is that it illustrates a point, vividly.I did learn something from it. Perhaps I was destined to learn that lesson. Maybe it was only so that I would speak about it now, so maybe others will think about it too.I had a bit of an unstable childhood, due to circumstances that were nobody’s fault, just unfortunate. As a consequence, I was moved around a lot between various places, and between my mother and grandmother.In one of the places that I lived with my mother, bless her soul, I kept some white mice. I was 11 or 12 years old. I can’t remember where they came from in the first place. I guess my mum must have gave them to me. They lived in a little cage with a wheel, that they could run on.They had to live in the attic, the only place that the owner of the place we were living in at the time would allow them to stay.There were two, at first.I guess they were a boy and a girl, because before long there were many.Too many in fact, to keep living in the cage. So I improvised another place for them to live, in the drawer of an old wooden desk, of the kind that the whole heavy desktop lid hinges up, opening a wide recess to keep books and things inside.It didn’t have a wheel. And it didn’t have any kind of windows. But it was big enough to house them all, and had plenty of gaps around the hinges and edges to give air. I put some bedding for them in there, changing it every few days, just as I had done with the cage, feeding them and filling their water bottle every day. There were about 14 of them by then.Then an upset happened. My mum was taken into hospital. I was moved to my grandmother’s house about 5 miles away. The mice didn’t come with me.It was about a week later that I realised they had been overlooked in the traumatic move. I remember thinking naively that someone would have made sure they were OK. I got on my bike immediately and cycled over to get them.When I opened the desk and looked in, there was only one in there, looking up at me. Damn, how had the others escaped? I looked all round the desk, but could find no evidence of a hole they might have somehow chewed or clawed through to get out.Then I looked again inside the desk and saw a detached paw, amongst the bedding. And then another. Then a tail. Then more paws. And more tails.With stomach churning, I realised the truth.The one left was the survivor of a cannibal feast.Every one of them bar this one had been eaten, probably alive, by a brother, a sister, mother, father, son, or daughter.All of its brothers and sisters, fighting to the death with one another. In the dark, and finally with it, losing.And it was my fault.I took the survivor back to my grandmother’s house again, in the cage with a wheel, with new straw, feeding and watering it. It didn’t run in the wheel though, not once. It hardly moved from one corner of the cage. Then it too died a few days later.Maybe some serious internal harm happened to it as a result of the hunger, or maybe it was just sick at how badly life had turned out for it. Who knows.I never kept any white mice again.I think about that event now and then, every time I see or hear about white mice, but also sometimes when I see how life seems to work for us too.When push comes to shove, we start eating one another.In fact, even worse, we in the richer parts of the world are eating others in the poorer parts of the world, all of the time, all through our lives.I mean that sort of metaphorically of course. But the brutal fact is; we live consuming resources that most often come from poorer parts of the world, whilst the people there die, either directly from lack of resources, or fighting for them, or just being killed for them.In our streets we see homeless. They strive to stay alive, eventually dying in sleeping bags and tents, whilst the more fortunate of us sleep in warm beds at night, spending each day variously striving to build capital, or maybe just trying to avoid ending up in the street ourselves.Each of us lives at the expense of every other. This situation is not that different from the mice. If we take it to its theoretical logical conclusion, one day, there will just be one person left on the planet.Just like the white mice.And yet, it doesn’t need to be like that. We don’t live in a cage with someone handing us our resources from outside.

525,52987,https://medium.com/@daniellutton82/password-security-tips-supertechman-91adba823651?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,Password Security Tips — SuperTechman,None,"SuperTechmanFollow--ListenShareVisit SuperTechmanPasswords are a ubiquitous part of the digital age. They are the digital keys to our networks of friends, our work colleagues, and even our banking and payment services. While some cybercriminals may want to hack into our social networking or email accounts, most want the financial gain that hacking bank accounts can bring.After many years working in the I.T industry, I have found that one of the biggest complaints I receive is the inconvenience that is coupled with the requirement to change passwords regularly and the volume of passwords that a user needs to remember. Surprisingly, the same complaints are made by those who display poor password habits such as using the same password everywhere and often use obvious tricks to please the conditions required such as simply adding or changing a number to the end of their original passwordPassword security is one of the critical problems in cyber security today. Many people are relaxed and would rather set an easy to remember password then to protect their valuable information and money. All a hacker needs is your user ID (say, e.g. notsodifficult@hackme.com) and in a matter of minutes can be invading your bank account or employee email account. You can go to a site https://howsecureismypassword.net to find out how long a hacker will take to hack your account. You will be surprised at the results. In the Below example I have used a pets name and some numbers.Rexy123!Here are some tips on what you should and should not do regarding passwords.Create a difficult-to-guess password — All user-chosen passwords must be difficult to guess. Words in a dictionary, derivatives of user-IDs, and common character sequences such as “123456” must not be employed. Likewise, personal details such as spouse’s name, vehicle license plate and birthday must not be used unless accompanied by additional unrelated characters.Contain as many characters as possible — longer is better, although some websites do have a limit: Passwordisreallyreallylong! is better than short1Include uppercase and lowercase — mix it up a bit, not just the first letter: ITSnotTOOhardTOMIXTHECASES!! is better than Generic1Include a number and/or symbol — Again, mix it up a bit. Don’t put the number or symbol at the beginning or the end: ADDSOMEsymbols$$HERE&THERE is better than Symbol$Include multiple words — Multiple words is easier to remember than a sting of random symbols, numbers, and letters: PASSphrasesarewhatyou#WANT244 is better than Password1Skip commonly used themes — such as birthdays, anniversaries or names of loved ones and pets. If someone knows you personally they are half way there.Never contain the name of a family member, friend, or pet — Father1950, Lucy98, Rexy1,Never contain the name of your town, or street address — Gympie2810, 31SmithSTTurn Letters into numbers and symbols. — Replacing a few letters with numbers and misspelling words or using acronyms and abbreviations is a great trick to make your password more unique i.e. 0 instead of o, 1 instead of l, $ instead of s. For example Daniel can then become D@n13!Never contain only a single word — Single dictionary words are the worst password you could choose. A cyber criminal attempting to log into accounts is going to access the accounts with the most simple passwords first. If you password can be found in a dictionary, your account will get compromised first.Play with your keyboard — Some passwords just don’t flow well. You can use your keyboard as a blank canvas and craft a new password from a pattern of keys.Passwords must never be reused — never construct passwords, which are identical or substantially similar to passwords that has been previously employed.Protection of passwords sent via eMail — Just like credit card details, never send login credentials via emailNever share passwords — Regardless of the circumstances, passwords must never be shared or revealed to anyone else besides the authorised user.Originally published at https://supertechman.com.au on November 2, 2019.----Unique blog that is aimed to provide I.T professionals Systems/Network administrators technical solutions, insights & knowledge on a wide variety of topics.SuperTechman--SuperTechman--SuperTechman--SuperTechman--Adam Drydenin2023 OWASP Top 10--Mike TakahashiinInfoSec Write-ups--Adam Drydenin2023 OWASP Top 10--Thexssrat--ProviesecinInfoSec Write-ups--popalltheshellsinSystem Weakness--2HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",SuperTechman,https://medium.com/,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*g7N0DgcucHkUkoX6q4X8hQ.jpeg",3,0

They’ve given rise to a multitude of new solutions, particularly automated and highly-efficient analytics streams that could systematically improve operations.When coupled with AI and machine learning, those data streams become a veritable treasure trove of insights. Such tools are capable of analyzing unprecedented quantities of information at superhuman speeds with little to no oversight.Of course, experienced professionals must pour over and digest the resulting data — a field we refer to as data science. These analysts take the information the machine spits out and convert it into a more readable form for others — primarily upper management and decision makers.New forms of information and customer profiles are now possible, segmented and categorized by details such as age, location or active regions, and even engagement levels. Yes, it’s now possible to measure and quantify the level of interest or engagement your audience has.But, for business — especially small- to medium-sized organizations — location intelligence and location data is one of the most useful streams.Why location intelligence mattersDatasets on their own are incredibly powerful and practical, there’s no question about it. With the right information, you can understand what your customers want, how your business or products are faring and how to make more-informed, almost predictive decisions in the future.Crucial to truly understanding context, however, is the idea of “where” or “when” a series of events come to pass. Most business intelligence systems allow you to see things like what purchases a customer made, the prices they paid, the time and date of the purchase and even the payment methods they used. But as with most businesses, it’s just as important to know where that purchase was made — as in what store — and what methods they used. Did the customer visit a local store? Were they out of town or out of the country? Did they make the purchase online?This information can further the data collected, too. You see, visualization is necessary to understand large swaths of data — many call this process “mapifying” your business data. But such a thing is only possible when you have location information attached to data streams or datasets. Location intelligence, specifically, involves the connection of information or data points with a geographical location — often denoted by location coordinates.Once you have a location attached, you can present or view the data in new, more revealing ways. This all helps to explain why location data is vital to understanding regions and their effect on your business and operations.Location intelligence will help inform and improve marketing, management, supply chain, logistics and customer support teams across a company.Where does AI fit in?AI and machine learning platforms can be deployed to analyze and process incredibly large stores of data quickly and accurately. The most promising aspect of these technologies, however — and where the “learning” term comes from in machine learning — is that they are continually improving over time as they ingest more data. They are already incredibly accurate and useful, but that improves more and more with each subsequent use of the tech.It’s why platforms like IBM’s Watson are not just becoming more capable, but being used to do new, innovative things outside of their original purpose. A system once developed to ingest and analyze vast streams of data and make sense of it is now capable of creating film trailers, playing games and even improving medical research.In location intelligence contexts, AI and big data technologies can be used to build highly complex models or algorithms with unprecedented levels of accuracy. These algorithms or frameworks, if you will, can then be used to take action or deploy a solution.Imagine taking large sets of data and applying it to business operations so you know when, where and how you can maximize revenue and success. Because that’s remarkably generalized, let’s consider a real-world scenario.Hurricane season is upon us, which means that on the east coast, many people are stocking up supplies and taking precautions to prepare their homes and families. Retailers and businesses can use this to increase and deliver the right products — the natural order of supply and demand.But imagine knowing exactly how climate and weather, human behaviour and local supply will affect operations. Both current and historical geographical data can be assessed to find this information — or, more importantly, put it to use in the current climate. Suddenly, a business understands not just what it needs, but how much, where it will be most in demand, when demand will rise or fall and how that affects production or scaling.Furthermore, once that algorithm is created — and delivers accurate insights — it can be leveraged a nearly infinite number of times in the future, and modified to fit within other scenarios or events.In this way, AI and machine learning really are just helping data scientists and analysts create streamlined frameworks for the practical application of datasets and information.Originally published at www.thedigitaltransformationpeople.com on January 25, 2019.----Helping you discover the what, how and who of digital transformation.

530,9561,https://medium.com/@iperity/emoji-communication-with-a-smile-97ef026e2184?source=tag_archive---------183-----------------------,Emoji: communication with a smile :-),Part 2: (Bot)ched Communication- What Do We Want From Bots?,"TalksomeFollow--ListenShareThe expression of emotion in the written word is quite an art. But it’s not very efficient: it takes time and energy to do it right. In the last decades, we’ve iterated through several ways to optimize communicating our emotions. What steps did we go through?The pace of (digital) communication has increased dramatically over the last decades. In the same time it would’ve cost a 1900’s British duke to write a love letter to his (hopefully) future partner, the average user of social media today has declared unconditional love to at least a couple dozen tweets, Instagrams, or instant messages.Conveying emotion in written communication used to be a case of simply finding the right words. But finding the right words isn’t always easy: even simple emotions can be difficult to express in a way that isn’t open to interpretation, particularly since it’s easy for someone else’s sarcasm to fly under your irony radar. For example, the sentence “The mother-in-law is visiting today. Great!” can be interpreted in more than just one way, and the first interpretation that comes to mind very likely depends on your own experience(s).When scientist Scott Fahlman suggested using :-) and :-( in 1982, his goal was to make sure it was easy for everyone to tell jokes from serious remarks. The idea got picked up by readers very quickly, and as a result, the predecessor of the internet (ARPANET) was full of similar smiley faces only a couple of months later.The proposed smiley faces fit perfectly with technology at the time, since computers didn’t have a lot of processing power and could only display text characters, no pixel graphics. On top of that, connections were all (very) low bandwidth. In other words: it was important to make every bit on the line count.Many were inspired by this addition to traditional text communication, and suggested clever and funny additions to the theme. Not all of them became as popular as :-) , but here are some you are likely to encounter in the wild:;-) Don’t take this too seriously, wink! :’-( Sad, crying :-P Naughty laugh :-9 Delicious! Licking lips <>< Fish @= Mushroom cloud *<<<- Christmas treeThe :-) gained popularity on ARPANET fast, but the network was only available to a limited set of people living in the US, making it a relatively local trend. Several years after Fahlman introduced the idea of the smiley, a different type of emoticon started to get noticed on the other side of the globe.^_^ The Japanese equivalent of the :-) with the carets representing the eyes.These type of smileys are called kaomoji, which is Japanese for “face characters”, and they were initially used in the signatures of messages on the Japanese online service called ASCII-NET. When the service started growing in the late 80’s, users started using them as a less formal and clearer way of communicating.Kaomoji exist in a great variety of ways, with different styles trending in China, Korea and other Asian countries, each including characters from their respective languages. What kaomoji all have in common is that they can be read without turning your head sideways. This approach made for a whole new level of creativity when it came to creating new faces, and the possibilities got even bigger with the introduction of new text characters:(T_T) Crying (^^’) Sweating (~^) Wink ♪┏(・o･)┛♪┗ ( ･o･) ┓♪┏ ( ) ┛♪┗ (･o･ ) ┓♪┏(･o･)┛♪ Dancing お(^o^)や(^O^)す(^｡^)みぃ(^-^)ﾉﾞ Good night! (╯°□°）╯ ︵ ┻━┻ Table flip Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ ButterflyThe usage of emoticons grew enormously after the internet was introduced and instant (text-only) messaging became mainstream in de 90’s with AIM, MSN and ICQ. However, there was one problem — with Eastern countries mostly using kaomoji, and Western countries mainly using smileys, a smile from Japan or a wink from the US were still not universally understood.In the second half of the 90’s, the Japanese interface designer Shigetaka Kurita was part of a team designing one of the very first mobile communication services, called i-mode. With mobile phone screens still being tiny at the time, and mobile data being expensive and paid per byte sent and received, a decision was made to limit the length of email messages to 250 text characters. In a sense, mobile text communications at that time faced challenges similar to those 15 years earlier.Kurita realised it was difficult to express yourself with just words in only 250 characters and subsequently started designing symbols to allow users to make the best use of the available space. The result was a set of about 200 symbols representing not just facial expressions, but also multiple red hearts, several animals, weather icons and everyday objects such as cars, cutlery and electronics. Kurita had created the very first set of emoji, which roughly translates to “picture characters”.The 12×12 pixels emoji became a selling point for i-mode, and competitors rushed to implement similar symbols in their messaging systems. This created a whole new problem; with every competitor implementing their own set of symbols and different technical implementations, using emoji was not cross-platform compatible.Some services created emoji translation tables to provide better compatibility, but the real solution to the problem came when in 2007, several Google employees submitted a request to include emoji in The Unicode Standard. Unicode is a standard for indexing characters from all over the world and describes how computers should encode them for worldwide compatibility. The request was honoured and thousands of emoji have been added since.Unicode is so well adopted these days, you can copy a sentence including emoji on Facebook and seamlessly paste it in iMessage, WhatsApp or a new tweet without losing the meaning of the message!Smileys, kaomoji, emoji. They are very similar ideas, beautifully developed within the restrictions of the technology of the time they were invented in. All of them are a huge success, most likely because they help people express themselves better, with less effort.That doesn’t mean to say that emoji have eliminated the problem of miscommunication. A message challenging friends to a refreshing water battle using (what looks to be) the water pistol emoji might turn up on their screens as a real looking pistol or revolver.

I nodded and glanced into the distance ahead of us. My original plan of dozing off for a few minutes before reaching the final destination of my weekend trip was seemingly thwarted by a chatty old lady sitting next to me. “Where are you headed, young man?” asked she, as she looked up at me with her wrinkly eyes. “Tijuana…, I am coming home for the weekend to…ehm, well it’s a family lunch,” have I replied sluggishly as I was still trying to focus my eyes on the Giza plateau ahead of us. Even now, many years after the archeologists fully mapped out and understood what used to be considered one of the biggest mysteries of the world, kept the pyramids their air of mystery and magnificent allure. “How sweet of you! Do you come home often?” asked me the lady in a hope to get the conversation going. “At least once a month! Although my mom is an avid traveler and she just loves Kabul, even though…,” have I continued when a loud laughter and a nudge in my ribs interrupted me. A voice on the other side of the aisle exclaimed suddenly, “So?! Did you miss me bro? You better, it’s been a while!” I twitched my body in a response to the nudge but quickly grew ecstatic and overjoyed! My brother has just returned from his third exploratory mission of the Mayall’s Object in the constellation of Ursa Major. “So you did get my message!?” I shouted euphorically. The operator said there was a lot of ionizing radiation in your quadrant due to the massive coronal mass ejection from a nearby star. “Phfff, that was nothing we couldn’t handle!” shunned Jorge my concerns. “We came back earlier, so I quickly located you and used QUAT[1] to get over here,” I can’t wait for us to be together again!My brother Jorge joined the Space Exploratory Agency only a few years ago, just before the heyday of the intergalactic space missions began in earnest. Whenever he managed to come back home to Earth he would crash at my place in Kabul and we would always have a great time as me and my friends all listened to his stories from the galaxies far, far away.“So how is Kabul?” asked Jorge. “It’s been great! The final phase of the Global Restorative Program (GRP), just kicked in. The place has been really revived over the last couple of years!”As many other places around the world that have been decimated by war and violent behavior manifested by the various nation states of what is now referred to as ‘pre-civilized’ world, Kabul has been completely rebuilt and its environment restored. In the post-transition period, the GRP program included some stunningly innovative technologies, such as Nano-Scale Material Disintegration and Recycling System or, the so called, PRoM [2], Predictive Rendering of Minerals. These two technologies proved to be indispensable in the years that followed the program kick-off and saw most of the habitat being revitalized while pre-fabricated residential hubs were 3D printed into existence. What used to be mostly a radioactive, barren wasteland has been transformed in only about 10 years into a lush burgeoning garden. Kabul has then become a new up and coming metropolitan area with an intercontinental transport hub and intra-galactic launch pad.Coming to Tijuana always invoked a lot of childhood memories. Sure, just like every other place, Tijuana also had its history and former reputation drawn from the primitive social organization and territorial dissection of the planet. The preceding state of global affairs was indeed a very dark place in which an outdated and stupefyingly dumb socio-economic system nearly destroyed the planet’s capacity to support complex life forms. Personally, I am not old enough to remember but my grandparents’ journals are full of stories we now find hard to comprehend.As my brother and I kept busy catching up on the last year and half of our lives, the train operating systems announced the next stop, “Dear Passengers, shortly will we arrive to Tijuana, thank you for traveling with Spherio!” “Yupieee, I am so excited to back home again!” shouted Jorge as he grabbed his bag and rushed out.Spherio, a global Evacuated Tube Transport Technology [3], was fully deployed at the end of the Great Transition — the time during which we segued from monetary-market economics to the current paradigm. As such, the system infrastructure is modeled based on the planetary geographic coordinate system of latitude and longitude lines with a number of auxiliary lines completing the main grid. At the onset, ET3 faced quite some headwinds as it represented a completely unparalleled way of transportation. Even now, decades after its introduction one can sometimes catch a glimpse of trepidation in the eyes of the older passengers as the pods begin to accelerate. At the maximum travel speed of 6,500 km/h, Kabul — Tijuana takes a little less than two hours.Coming back home was always very rewarding largely because of the massive improvements experienced by the region. In fact, the entire Mesoamerica has seen a lot of changes in the previous years. Right after the global society stabilized the global climate, we tackled the next challenge that plague the so called Ring of Fire for a very long time. A system of measures commonly referred to as ‘Tectonic Stability System’ was introduced to pinpoint and safely release any imminent seismic threats that could put lives in jeopardy. If you went to Tijuana only a generation ago, the place still looked pretty barren compared to its contemporary image. Furthermore, the region hugely benefited from the deployment of Cybernated Farm Systems (CFS) [4], a fully automated Smart Aquaponic Greenhouse system, which eliminated the gap between global food production and distribution of clean, healthy foods to the people of the world. CFS systems played a major role in phasing out the 17th century styled agriculture, which wasted water, ruined soils and climate and suffered from capricious weather.As we approached our parents’ house, my brother and I greeted familiar faces from our past. Tijuana has for a long time now been one of the world’s most important centers of artistic expression. The main reason was the role arts played in communicating global socio-economic changes prior to the beginning of the Great Transition. To a large extent, arts became one of the main international languages and a powerful vehicle for global change.Zigzagging around my home-town led me to reminisce about my childhood in Tijuana. By now, I’ve known the way home backwards. First, Cerro Colorado, a place where the famous ‘common heritage’ speech heralding a new era in Earth’s history was delivered, followed by my Alma mater — The Academy of Curiosity & Experimentation, and, finally, a large mural embellished with a quote that become an ethos of the pre-transition times, ‘You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.’ We were home![1] QUAT is a technology based on quantum entanglement that revolutionized intra- and intergalactic transportation in the late 21st century by means of quantum teleportation.[2] Predictive Rendering of Materials was developed specifically for the purpose of tackling mineral and inorganic substance shortages around the world without the need for mining which was phased out as a primitive and destructive method of mineral acquisition.[3] Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies (ET3) is a technology based on the application of the High Temperature Superconductive Maglev in vacuum. At the height of its maximum speed the equatorial ET3 line takes about 6 hours and 10 minutes to circle the earth.

533,29822,https://medium.com/@biancawylie/sidewalk-toronto-and-now-people-of-toronto-what-say-you-about-your-democracy-bebe2a0ba46e?source=tag_archive---------5-----------------------,"Sidewalk Toronto: And Now People of Toronto, What Say You About Your “Democracy”?",None,"Bianca WylieFollow--1ListenShareBecause this is not mine. This is a crisis of mediocrity.Yesterday I was confronted multiple times with a lie that cannot stand.The lie is repeated endlessly, brute forcing its ways into a public narrative, no doubt to be picked up and retold, so let this lie be singled out for dedicated attention: there was no public consultation.And before I move onto this problematic lie about public engagement, a quick note about that oped from Anne Golden and Alan Broadbent that came out today — this in particular: “But what connects these disparate groups [the critics] is that their doubts are born out of the fundamental premise, unspoken or otherwise, that if this all went south, Toronto wouldn’t be able to fight back or hold its own.”The deeply unfortunate thing about this framing of critics is that it shows a failure to understand what our opposition is doing within our democratic frame. So I’ll spell it out. And I find this somewhat tragic-comic because after I do this I’d be surprised if they weren’t onside with us.The push on the vendor is to make more space for a better negotiating position for the public. Do I really have to say this out loud? Evidently. As anyone that has ever been an advocate for public interest knows, sometimes your job is to create air cover for what has to happen inside government. In this case, cover is accomplished by focusing on two things: 1. Making sure that Sidewalk’s tactics and operating approaches are known and visible and 2. Making sure government is given the space, resources, and time to do its job properly.There have been decades of under-investment in the people and systems that are tasked with creating the regulatory response to many of the issues related to this project. They’re hard. And I’m sick to death of seeing the public service get more and more piled onto the side of their desks or outsourced to professional service firms by entrenched power that does not understand what they are asking the public service to do.The regulatory challenges and the impacts of the digital era don’t stop in the public spaces we’ve been talking about — they’re throwing the democratic house, and our public service, into disorder and rapid change too. Everything is in flux. That’s why the severity of the issues must be flagged endlessly. Out of respect for the space and time our public servants, and we as people in a democracy, need to do our job properly. It would be heartening if the people that are keen to sound off now about how “we’ve got this” would show some awareness of the work that people that oppose this project have done for civic and public technology policy, both locally and globally.Of course we can do this. The argument isn’t about whether we have the muscle, confidence, or capacity to do it. There is a difference between outside voices and inside voices with family business (aka our democracy). The question is why wouldn’t we have the confidence to do it on our own terms and time. That’s power. Capital will come and go, there’s lots of it out there. Building democratic and institutional strength? That feels more like a moment in time opportunity.Ceding the framing of this work to this company is a decision to put ourselves in a weak negotiating position because this work never attained social license. This process is building us further into a house of cards with a shaky foundation. Going in further on that is not confidence. That’s what insecurity looks like. That’s fear. Confidence is saying no because we’ve got a clear line of sight on the stakes and the options. Confidence is saying yes to doing this properly without a glaringly anti-democratic input clouding the water.The Democratic RuptureBack to the corporate capture of public engagement. There was no public engagement. There was corporate capture of process.The numbers being used to defend what is coming now are theatrical devices. Props. And all three governments are complicit in the manufacture of this particular lie. They’ve been party to lies like this before. So I understand why people don’t care. I understand this now in a way I didn’t two years ago.I understand now how normal these lies are. They are so normal that two deeply respected and thoughtful leaders stepped onside with the program publicly today by saying of critics of the project that “Some are politicians who fear the public interest is being breached”.The public interest is being breached.Public interest has already been breached.It’s not personal to point this out. It’s not us vs. them. It’s where do we disagree and how do we manage that area. Supporters are not making good public arguments that the process is defensible. I like lots of people that like this project, no matter how much others want to tell a different story. But I personally will ask for more from my democracy, I will fight for more from my democracy, and I am not ashamed to do so. I’m sorry Toronto that you want to move forward without naming the problems happening but we can’t get there without the mess. That’s what democracy is. Messy.A democracy that has made space for this lie, that there was public consultation on the issues that actually matter, is a shell, a phantom, a name and label to gesture at. And democracy is not broken. It is working exactly as designed when it intersects with corporate power, entrenching and consolidating power within the establishment. The part I didn’t see as clearly back in 2017 was that it didn’t matter whether that power was corporate or governmental or non-governmental. I thought we still had lines. I have no shame in admitting how often I’m wrong. On this I was very wrong.In this project established power has fused together in a way that I didn’t think was legal or possible. And when governments start breaking unwritten rules they have the power of trust of to pave the way. They can do it all in public. They can mix words and roles in the comfort of elected authority because other powers are telling you it’s fine. Life if busy. Competing attention spans and all.I have watched the vendor in this process expose a little bit of a beam of light though, a little beam that may show the political system and process norms here may yet be a little bit different from the United States. Maybe behind them. It’s worth digging our fingers into this crack and breaking it open a bit further. It may be nothing, but it may also be something important.Permissible Use of Money in Public Sector ProjectsI’ve been trying to get my head around how to successfully express why the process that is happening should have everyone’s alarms ringing loud and looking for the kill switch. The worst part of this deal has already happened. It’s not the plan. It’s the process. And given that it’s not been enough to have the Prime Minister allude to a “the fix was in” selection process of the vendor, let’s try another track.Using a firm like Navigator on the PublicNavigator is a firm that does messaging, strategic communications, gets opeds placed in the media, picks who has influence and gets them to weigh in on public issues, etc. Its job is to create and control a message. Its slogan is “When you can’t afford to lose”.Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs are, through their existing legal contract, the Plan Development Agreement, doing joint public relations and government relations. What Sidewalk Labs does, it does in the name of Waterfront Toronto. And through Waterfront Toronto, Sidewalk Labs acts on behalf of all three levels of Canadian government. Based on what I’ve seen in the media and in exchanges with Waterfront Toronto I would think that Sidewalk Labs is in breach of contract but I’m not a lawyer.What has happened since November 2017 and continues up until today is a process in which all governments are complicit in manufacturing consent, through the payment of a company with that explicit assignment. Actively taking no off the table. Only “how” is allowed. Only how do we do this.“No” has become “Losing”. “When you can’t afford to Lose”The process was designed not to ask people what to think about the set-up as a whole — not to question the governance and the relationship between the actors. It buried the land grab, the infrastructure finance, the revenue schemes, the things that should have been front and centre from day one.Instead it was all framed in terms of what people were allowed to think about and talk about and weigh in on in order to get this deal done. The rest was presented as normative good and a done deal. The process was fixed. It’s what the $50 million USD bought.There have been many many devices used to accomplish this. I’m not saying this is all Navigator by any means, some are other companies, some is Sidewalk Labs in-house knowledge, lots of it has nothing to do with money at all. I’m saying Navigator because it’s an explicit contract and it helps to use a concrete example.This is a blurring of the lines that brings the tactics and methodology of a Navigator onto the public. Imagine if the City of Toronto hired Navigator to work on a public consultation? (And I mean, maybe that’s even happened before — I don’t know. Like I said, democracy is not in a great phase). That’s what, in essence, is happening here. Money is being used against the public to get them onside before a democratic process between government and people begins. Co-signed by all levels of government. It’s what some amount of money is being used for/has been used for.When you design a defensible public process one of the core tenets of the design is what is on and off the table. What is up for debate and what is not.Silence has been a killer here. The contract that Waterfront Toronto entered into effectively muzzled them. And now the establishment is celebrating a bully that has not shown itself worthy of our respect or time. Can we handle it? Of course. Should we ask more of our vendors? I’d argue yes.Why are the opening salvos of these supporters’ pieces so consumed with what the opposition is saying? Why so many words and sentiments being placed there? Why not tell some great stories about the global track record on regulatory design for tech companies? Procurement is an absolute tire fire and has been for twenty years at least. The narrative about strength in the face of these truths is being co-opted again, out of context. The strength in this situation does not lie with engaging this company. The strength lies in valuing our civic worth and seeing the opportunity cost of playing defence. But here the civic imagination of the establishment clearly fails.It’s also fascinating to me that on the heels of the Chair of Waterfront Toronto’s board asking for some respect regarding process, these two individuals feel it’s an appropriate time to weigh in with more establishment support that undoubtedly ratchets up the pressure to make a deal here, to show that Toronto has “got this”. I empathize deeply with Stephen Diamond in this moment. Deeply.What Does New Power Look Like?So can we do this? Of course we can. The outcome of the trajectory that this process is pointing us towards? More of the same. The status quo. Power begets power. This isn’t about whether we can withstand this, or whether we can manage it. The question is why is some of the establishment so excited to play defence instead of taking their full power and building this out on our own terms? New power isn’t carrying on with more of the same.The fatal flaw in the RFP for this project, an item that will no doubt be studied for years to come — is how it was designed to enable corporate capture of regulatory process, for things both physical and digital. This was, unfortunately, an extension of well-considered flexibility in Waterfront Toronto. An intention that could be taken out of context and abused, turned up ten-fold under the eye of leadership that’s no longer in the building.The common theme of what has happened in the last twenty months is erosion and blurring lines — this is how democracy further dissolves. And the set-up to enable this was perfect. There are multiple narratives that can make this seem like an inevitability, and why we need saving through “partnership” and “collaboration”. What we need is leadership and confidence in our democracy. We can rebuild trust with all of our institutions. The next six months will be an interesting test of who is interested in doing that, whose power they want to line up behind, and how.----1Bianca Wylie--1Bianca Wylie--Bianca Wylie--Bianca Wylie--Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Alex Mathers--228Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Bianca Wylie,https://medium.com/,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*o2dpf4SQYpgj_UVdRHV4XQ.jpeg",9,11
535,52407,https://medium.com/@MIGSInstitute/short-circuit-what-will-artificial-intelligence-mean-for-diplomacy-f4629dbf3140?source=tag_archive---------83-----------------------,Short circuit: What will artificial intelligence mean for diplomacy?,None,"MIGSFollow--ListenShareOver the past decade and a half, the rise of new technologies, social media platforms in particular, has transformed the field of diplomacy. Diplomats have new tools at their disposal, and social media now puts global audiences in easy reach of foreign policymakers, allowing governments to reach out to these audiences instantly. They are able to foster an exchange of ideas between individuals and civil society at home and abroad. Social media continues to drive an ongoing evolution of how countries can develop and leverage their “soft power”.While social media platforms are easy to use and complement the work of diplomats, they have also become a double-edged sword. When social media was in its infancy, very few experts predicted that these same tools would be used by authoritarian states to launch misinformation campaigns, spy on citizens, harvest personal data, or interfere in the democratic elections of other states. Neither did many anticipate that non-state actors would use these technologies to plan attacks, incite violence online, broadcast propaganda, and brainwash others to engage in violent extremism.Diplomats are now in a constant cycle of needing to update their ways of working to deal with the evolving challenges the stem from emerging technologies. One such frontier technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), is fast starting to reshape our world. It is imperative that diplomats understand the key concepts of AI, how AI will impact diplomacy and international relations, and how it might be deployed for malicious purposes.Why is this important? Because the AI evolution is happening now. It will continue to reshape most, if not all, industries and professions, including diplomacy. Diplomats need to see AI as a new addition to the wider toolkit that states use to influence other states and non-state actors. AI will permit countries to assert more power in the digital space and influence digital actors.Diplomats receive regular training on language, culture, negotiation skills, religion, and international law, to name just a few. Going forward, they will need to have a conceptual and practical understanding of AI. Machine learning, algorithms, automation, bots, deepfakes and machine-driven communications tools (MADCOMS) all need to become part of the diplomat’s lexicon.Information WarfareIn the Atlantic Council report “MADCOM Future”, Matt Chessen details how MADCOMS, “[t]he integration of AI systems into machine-driven communications tools for use in computational propaganda computational propaganda,” are developing at break neck speeds.MADCOMS have the potential to produce highly personalized propaganda that will enhance various actors’ ability to influence people by tailoring persuasive, distracting, or intimidating messaging. Computational propaganda includes the use of automation, algorithms, and big-data analytics to manipulate public life by spreading disinformation online, producing automated amplification with bots and fake accounts.This type of AI can extrapolate trends and large-scale patterns of behavior, which can be used to influence opinions, choices and decisions of individuals and the wider society being targeted. It is expected to lead to dynamic content generation, psychometric profiling, and automated video and audio manipulation tools. Massive amounts of online data can be processed to identify people based on their personality, political preferences, religious affiliation, demographic data, and other personal interests.Falsifying Reality: DeepfakesDeepfakes, which are media (video, audio, and images) altered by AI to falsify reality, pose a unique challenge. Their potential impact should not be underestimated. They can be used to exploit or sabotage individual identities, undercut rational decision-making, distort policy debates, manipulate elections, erode trust in institutions, exacerbate social cleavages, generate civil unrest, and disrupt bi-lateral relations between countries. Imagine the non-consensual computer-generated version of an elected official’s face, such as Barrack Obama, using a series of pictures that closely matches the original expressions of another person in a video.This technology can make anyone appear to say or do something that they never said or did, e.g. speaking in derogatory tones towards an ethnic or religious group. These AI-enabled methods that allow the creation of deepfakes are becoming more and more sophisticated, easily accessible, and relatively low-cost to produce. They also have the potential to become all-the-more threatening if used by computational propagandists for political manipulation.Nefarious actors continue to generate innovation in AI for machine-generated influence of public opinion and sow division. The ongoing diplomatic spat between Canada and Saudi Arabia is a case in point. When the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh issued a statement in Arabic on Twitter calling for the Saudi government to release women’s rights activists in the Kingdom, the Canadian government observed that AI powered bots were quickly deployed to foment societal divisions and encourage “separatist sentiments in Quebec”, threatening the country’s political stability.AI models will increasingly be misused to generate fake news and spread malicious disinformation. Sophisticated algorithms are being developed to complement and eventually overtake what actual people are doing. In “The Coming Automation of Propaganda” article for War on The Rocks, Frank Adkins and Shawn Hibbard warned “recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may soon enable the automation of much of this work, massively amplifying the disruptive potential of online influence operations.”Former Chief of the Russian General Staff Yuri Baluyevsky said a few years ago that a victory in information warfare “can be much more important than victory in a classical military conflict, because it is bloodless, yet the impact is overwhelming and can paralyze all of the enemy state’s power structures.” Russia has a long history of exacerbating divides on fractious social issues by targeting susceptible minority groups. It would be naïve for diplomats to believe AI will not be weaponized by Russia, other authoritarian states, and malicious non-state actors.Moving ForwardWe are headed toward a future where machine-driven communications, enabled by AI tools, will dominate the online information environment. Soon, it may impossible for people to tell whether they are interacting with a human or a robot online.Authoritarian states, where journalists and civil society organizations have little to no freedom to hold governments accountable for the unethical use of AI, face little to no constraints in how they use these emerging technologies globally and against democracies. At the same time, AI gives authoritarian states a technological edge in an expanding digital world. At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland, George Soros singled out China’s use of AI against its citizens and open societies as a “mortal threat”.Democratic governments are starting to act. Global Affairs Canada has established the Center for International Digital Policy that monitors and responds to the misuse of AI. The Canadian Foreign Service Institute has begun training Canadian diplomats on the impact of AI cluster technologies on diplomacy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands has created the annual “Digital Diplomacy Camp” event, which brings together tech experts and civil society leaders under one roof to shares ideas and best practice with Dutch diplomats.While this is a positive start, diplomats must catch up before it is too late. Democratic and open societies need to empower their diplomats and provide them with additional resources and training on all aspects of AI. Given the internet is international, it is imperative countries see the emergence of AI as a global issue, not just a technical one.Kyle Matthews is Executive Director of the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies at Concordia University.

536,39628,https://medium.com/@nelu/a-not-distant-future-of-cloud-computing-de17742b0bbf?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,A not Distant Future of Cloud Computing,"Nelu Mihai, Tiffine Wang","Nelu MihaiFollow--ListenShareSeries: A Venture Capitalist and an Entrepreneur in CloudsThis article has the goal of providing some personal perspective about what may be the next developments in the cloud, what we consider it needs to be fixed, and what may be future trends. We try to address topics, such as the missing theoretical model of cloud computing, cloud computing as a programming paradigm, time and timing of applications, security, quantum computing in cloud, edge computing, multicloud networking, social implications of cloud, the functional model of cloud, data, information and knowledge, artificial intelligence and future of open source.The intention is to have short paragraphs, which are a catalyst for new ideas, proposed improvements of current trends. We intend to express a thought not to exhaust or ultimately justify a theory.On some topics, we take a contrarian approach with well-established trends and famed people. This is not because we want to have a different opinion, but we consider that they deserve a robust debate. The history of humankind and science shows that, in some cases, the conclusion of the majority is based on superficiality, inertia, fame, and power. By analyzing the data in-depth, we may conclude that these opinions are incorrect and not backed by reality or at least statistical probability. We do not claim that we are always right, but we consider that a dialectic approach is the best avenue to truth.Almost all server software used in the cloud was built some time ago and was designed for a single or cluster of servers. All cloud providers use Linux as the primary software/compute quantum. Linux is a technology built on principles described almost 40 years ago. Is Linux the right compute operating system for multi-cloud? Can it run applications designed for hyper distributed cloud computing or cloud native computing? How about containers or virtual machines? Are they the “quantum mechanics” for multi-cloud? How will we be able to schedule applications using millions of containers running simultaneously on different clouds by using linear schedulers capable of scheduling just several containers or pods (Kubernetes) at a time? We will perhaps need new technologies. What about data? The problem with data is not that we will not have enough space to store it, but how we can securely make sense of it, without necessarily processing every byte. Does it make sense to store all the data we acquire? We tend to neglect the carbon footprint of our data centers, but it is significant, especially for video streaming. The training of a single AI model can generate as much carbon as 5 cars in their lifetime. Can we build data centers, which are more efficient but also generating more processing power?And above all, do we have in place the right abstractions for cloud, multi-cloud or inter-cloud? Why do we need correct concepts? They will allow us to build more efficient data centers and applications. At the same time, it will have a significant contribution to saving our planet from climate change by limiting the CO2 emissions on Earth’s atmosphere.A researcher noticed that though much computing today has become cloud computing, a search on “theoretical cloud computing” returns only nine results, whereas “theoretical computing” returns more than 22,000. A search on “theory of cloud computing” returned only 200 results, whereas “theory of computing” returned 7,000,000 (searches conducted 10 September 2018).We need a mathematical model for the cloud. We need a model that satisfies the rigors of computer science, not just customer requirements.We view cloud today as a distributed set of computers. A more elaborated model should consider the cloud as a generalized computing system. Going further, we should observe that processing of data, and inter-relationships or dependencies among processing engines and data are equally important in the cloud. This observation brings us to the conclusion that by using in conjunction the theory of field and theory of computing, we could describe the cloud as a computing field or computational field. Using a similar mathematical methodology, we can make an analogy of cloud computing with the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field.We conjecture that modeling cloud as a computing field provides significant advantages by comparison to other paradigms.Furthermore, it is possible to describe the cloud by an extension of the Turing machine applied to a distributed knowledge graph state machine with N-dimensional attributes allocated to every node or edge (such as costs, resources, data). This approach will take us into a computational-complexity space with scheduling and resource allocation problems being NP-complete.Cloud computing needs an open architecture based on comprehensive and straightforward architecture.Theoretically, we can describe cloud computing as a computing field.Cloud computing should be perceived as a programming paradigm, not as the phenomenon of transitioning of all enterprise local hardware and software to public cloud providers. It is not about running applications on third-party infrastructure. It is not about to stop buying hardware for our data centers and letting them decaying or disaffecting them. It is about how we program our applications to run natively on top of distributed processing and data. In this context, Cloud Native is a concept that looks more profound by comparison to terms such as public and private clouds, hybrid and multi-cloud. The location of resources should be irrelevant, and applications should be agnostic of them. The next generation of services or applications should be designed with native support for grid computing and grid data. The elasticity of scaling should be naturally supported at the software infrastructure level.Current cloud representations are linear while the cloud is functionally multidimensional. We are not able today to programmatically evaluate (without human intervention) the performance or efficiency of a service running on multiple nodes. We have to use complicated dashboards and histograms to approximate them qualitatively. Why do we need so many dashboards? They are annoying, confusing, and inefficient. We need precise quantitative methods to calculate basic multidimensional cloud metrics and programmatically feed them as input into appropriate functions. If the cloud is monitored programmatically, the control of it can be done by implementing automation loops. By implementing automation loops, we will be able to predict cloud behavior and dynamically change its behavior. We can learn from the theory of automation used so widely and efficiently to run our industrial processes. Processing data should become an industrial process, which does not need any human intervention to control it.Do we measure correctly the time used by applications with components running simultaneously on several nodes located on different data centers across the globe? PTP is doing a decent job at the network level, but is NTP the correct timing protocol for cloud applications and services? Do we synchronize the myriads of containers, microVMs, and VMs efficiently? What is the standard multidimensional execution unit in the cloud? Should time become a natural semantics of cloud programming? This approach would allow us to write deterministic cloud software with predictable behavior and thus easier to control.We are using cloud technologies, which are not suitable for multidimensional or cloud native applications, services, architectures, software, or hardware. What about time and its impact on processing; timing, and its implications on the synchronization of inter-processing and data dependencies? Maybe, in cloud computing, time is not absolute as we consider it today, but relative as in the theory of relativity?Currently, security is an afterthought in the cloud. It is not built-in in its DNA. The zero-trust concept is the correct tactical step forward. However, diverting all traffic to a public cloud to check it for security breaches and resending it back to enterprise, after cleansing, cannot be the future, despite being now in fashion for functionalities such as firewalls, intrusion detection, etc. It will increase the Internet traffic, and the technology will fade away as the public cloud concept is evolving into the hyper distributed cloud. It will negatively contribute to climate change. The principle of least privilege is a well-accepted security concept in the cloud; we should adapt it to the processing as well. Over-processing of data does not make it more secure: this is the principle of less processing. We should focus on qualitative, not quantitative processing. We believe that the long-term solution is hardware-based with security processing done at the endpoints. Peer-to-peer secure transactions will become the norm. Blockchain technologies will play a significant role if cheap security processors support them. The future of cloud security is not in aggregating processing in public clouds but in (i) improving endpoints’ security capability, (ii) correlated with support from “mobile security agents” crawling the Internet and (iii) implementing unique identifiers for every API. APIs should be defended, not just users and applications: security at the microscopic level.Current cryptography relies on a simple principle of asymmetry: it is easier to do some things than undo them. With symmetric cryptography this imbalance of asymmetry is exponential. Adding one bit to the key size increases the computational complexity with 1%, but doubles the cost to break it. With the cloud, we can naturally increase the size of the keys, split them into many parts, and stored them in different computes in different clouds. We should be able to change their locations like shuffling a deck of cards randomly. We are secure in the foreseeable future from the menace of quantum computing breaking current security mechanisms. However, hackers using quantum computing may be able to create new algorithms capable of overcoming our advances.Will quantum computing influence cloud computing? Many engineers, when talking about quantum computing, think about higher speed and processing power. But a significant value of quantum computing will be to help address and solve new types of problems in the class of TSP problem of Hamilton and The seven bridges in Konigsberg of Euler. Quantum computing will take graph theory to a new level and will allow us to use multidimensional optimization theory to run workloads more efficiently, predictably. Today, we are wasting many billions of dollars on the cloud bills and are destroying the world with carbon emissions of our data centers as multidimensional optimization is an afterthought, not part of the cloud DNA. Quantum computing will help increase, at a massive scale, the parallelism of applications and assume the control of interrelationships among them. Quantum computing can make optimization a modus vivendi of cloud computing. Can quantum computing extend superposition and entanglement at the macroscopic level, as well (i.e., at the application level)? That will be a game-changer. Quantum computing could scale exponentially if quantum chips could hold just one more qubit from one generation to the next or if qubits could be more precise from one generation to the next. Or maybe quantum computing is not even achievable, is a chimera as some researchers claim.A useful quantum computer needs 1000–100,000 logical qubits and to process a set of continuous parameters that is larger than the number of subatomic particles in the universe. How significant is this number? Well, it is 2^1000 or around 10^300. How are we going to keep errors under control, for 10^300 continuous parameters that must be processed?The development of large scale quantum computing may end up being too difficult for one single company. This effort needs the resources of an entire country of the scale of the USA. An Apollo equivalent program for quantum computing may be necessary. In any case, quantum and cloud computing could exponentially amplify each other.Edge computing is, in fact, an aspect of the evolution toward hyper distributed cloud computing. As we underscored above, cloud computing is a programming paradigm that will morph itself in time into native cloud computing. Applications implemented on the native cloud should run naturally on distributed computation and data grids designed with built-in elasticity of resources and data. All devices capable of computational processing should be able to participate latently in the universal cloud while, at the same time, be an access point for every user. The logic should be intelligently deployed close to the data acquisition points to minimize the amount of transferred data. Moving petabytes of data from the edge to core, to process it on a public cloud, does not make any sense. Increasing the wireless communication bandwidth with 5G and the next generation of wireless technology are making the edge more accessible to data-hungry applications.5G will transform the Internet in a universal LAN where the bandwidth of connectivity will not be anymore a bottleneck. In conjunction with the continuous evolution of local memory technologies and processing power, 5G will make video streaming the modus vivendi of human-machine-human communication.The evolution of edge cloud computing is happening in parallel with another transformational trend: the distributed generation of electrical power. We are deploying hundreds of millions (soon billions) of edge devices generating locally electrical energy from wind and solar. Every single wind generator or solar module can become not just a generator of energy but also a computing processing engine. The triad local energy producer-processing power producer-5G is the perfect technology combination needed for building edge micro-clouds, which do not require centrally generated energy. Every wind generator or solar installation can become a micro data center. The tremendous power of large numbers will be the development engine of edge computing.Marc Andreessen has successfully coined the phrase “Software will eat the world.” Let’s think about that. How about the billions of smartphones, trillions of IoT devices, and hardware chips needed for them? If we compare the semiconductor Wall Street Index with the software IT index, we notice that the former has grown significantly higher than the latter. We have to re-evaluate the importance of micro, nano, and pico hardware. A new generation of microchips based on quantum computing will allow us to run complicated algorithms closer and inside hardware. The current security problems on the Internet and cloud cannot be solved without a new generation of integrated chips. Software is not the solution of cyber-security because the software’s logic is easily accessible and will be penetrated sooner or later. The simpler the software, the more secure the Internet will be. How about robotics? What can software alone do without mechanical and electronics support? The duality software-hardware is as essential as the space-time concept in theory of relativity, wave-corpuscle in nuclear physics and electricity-magnetism in electromagnetic field theory.Survivability and scalability are essential attributes for the architecture of the Internet. However, cloud infrastructure needs to be efficient from performance and cost standpoints. It should be designed differently than the Internet, by inserting in the system knowledge about the entire cloud topology and some of its state. To send a packet on the Internet, basically, three software objects are needed: source, destination, and the next hop. Only some distributed state is shared, and there is almost no global state.Nevertheless, the design of modern hyper distributed clouds will include global state, and this will allow us to build efficient applications with minimum power consumption. Let’s make an analogy. The cloud information model should be designed using a model similar to federated countries: with a large enough local state but also a relevant global state. This architecture will make it more efficient. We call this the principles of maximum minimorum of global state and the minimum maximorum of the local state. The new generation of cloud architecture may drive a novel design of the Internet. AWS is already hinting at that. We also anticipate that a new generation of specialized integrated chips will contribute to more intelligent network elements. With the advances of NFV, networks will become as programmable and open as general-purpose computers. Hopefully, in the future, we will not use any more IP addresses (layer three abstractions) when working with applications and services (layer 6–7 abstractions). This new revolution of network design will transition the design from “assembly language” (IP address, subnet masks, port numbers) to a higher level of abstraction of the application interfaces. From the evolution point of view, networking is now in the era of numbers or arithmetic, to make an analogy. However, one day, some modern al-Khwarizmi and Leibnitz will define the algebra and differential/integral calculus of networking. Early pioneering work at Bell Labs and the University of Columbia are the foundation of open programmable networks and software defined networking, but we still work with numbers in networking. We believe that cloud computing will accelerate the revolution of networking, as we need to invent more efficient networks.Funny note: “A stateless application is a lifeless application.”Many professionals talk about “stateless applications” and how different products address them. The claim that there are “stateless applications” borders ignorance. Containers are usually the main culprit for that. Each piece of code (even one single assembly instruction) has a state. A real application can have either a temporary or a persistent state, but it will always have a state.The launch of AWS Lambda has triggered the Serverless movement, which has propagated rapidly to all cloud providers and technologies. It is growing faster than other cloud technologies, but it is incomplete. Serverless is by far more straightforward than other techniques to implement cloud applications, but the user still has to handle the other resources explicitly: data, applications, databases, etc. We believe that a complete functional model of the cloud, agnostic from all resources perspective is achievable. This paradigm will have a tremendous impact on “builders” (as @Andy Jassy calls them). It will attract by far more implementers of cloud applications due to a new level of simplicity of working with the cloud. Serverless movement is just a temporary transition to a complete functional model of cloud.We are using cloud technologies, which are not suitable for multidimensional cloud native applications, services, architectures, software, or hardware. Should all computers in the world have the ability to become, in an ad-hoc manner, part of multi-cloud processing? We have invested around $20B in Uber for promoting universal ride-sharing as a service. How about creating technologies, allowing all unused capacity of all computing capable devices (computes, smartphones, etc.) to create a universal cloud of clouds, available to everybody in an ad-hoc and on-demand manner. Blockchain can play an essential role in building a secure, peer-to-peer, and entirely distributed universal computing system. This approach could have almost infinite processing capacity (at the Earth scale), which guarantees the correctness and privacy of all transactions. Enterprise would be able to use this Internet Computer to run proprietary applications/services on it. Think about next Google or Facebook running on an open Internet. An Internet-scale computer will tremendously stimulate innovation and prosperity. We share these ideas with @Dominic Williams, the leading mind behind Difinity.org. We consider the Dfinity project one of the most revolutionary enterprises of our time.Cloud computing and economics are intertwined. The physical outsourcing of software and hardware moves the center of gravity from capital expenses to operational expenses. “AWS is cheap as long as you do not use it too much.” Being able to account for and measure cloud activities at the “quantum” level is essential for the cloud economy. It is not about cents but micro, nano and pico cents. Blockchain allows the transition of microeconomics to quantum economics. By definition, the monetary system is based on discrete values. Well, blockchain creates a dualism discrete-continuum which enables us to “quantum-fy” (quantumfy) microscopic amounts almost at the continuum level. And that is essential for the management of micro-values at large scale, in space and time. It is as vital as the processing of error correction and noise elimination in micro and nanoelectronics. Without solving them, the integrated circuits industry would not have existed. Blockchain and cryptography will allow us to: (i) design viable business models for large scale cloud computing services that have a high rate of growth and (ii) also to quantify accurately small but impactful projects.There is so much marketing about AI, but scientifically speaking nothing of high relevance happened in the last years. We need we make significant progress on fundamental research on unsupervised learning and AGI. The state-of-the-art intelligence of current systems is just mostly capable of approximating with high probability that a cat is a cat, and not a dog, and vice-versa (just kidding). Tremendous fundamental research is needed, not marketing hype! Many AI applications cannot function properly without a significant amount of curated data. The challenge of AI is to build systems that can operate with a limited amount of initial data, with the capability to acquire the needed data on their own and improve themselves without re-programming. AI should help us build applications without being required to be expert software engineers. AI software should be able to write software better than the vast majority of software engineers, similarly with how currently computers can play chess better than 99.99% of humankind. The human brain is our role model. If we can achieve 10% of its capability by using just 100 times more energy than our brain needs for that, well, that is progress. Data is not the correct “fuel” abstraction for AI. Our senses work with data, but the brain works with knowledge. The integrated circuits are made of sand, but they work with transistors and gates, not sand. Cloud computing provides AI with all the processing power needed to transition to unsupervised learning. On another side, AI can give cloud the engine for self-control and self-healing.Cloud computing can help Artificial General Intelligence become a reality.Purpose-built databases are the new kid on the block. The complexity of cloud applications requires efficient handling and access to different types of data simultaneously. On another side, general-purpose databases can achieve that by having native cloud architecture. Soon, all databases: structured and unstructured, purpose-built, and general-purpose will become cloud native. In complex applications, it is difficult to apriori decide what type of databases we need for different kinds of data. Only after we start using the data and after some execution experience, we will be able to make the right association of a type of data with the correct database type. Here AI can help. We need to learn to work with knowledge. Let’s make an analogy: a picture is a data, a movie frame with associated sound is information, and a movie with its story is knowledge. By watching education movies, we accumulate knowledge, not data. A library of books is a universe of knowledge, not just data. AI should work directly with knowledge and let the system figure out how it can be decomposed in information and further in data. AI could latently decide how and where data should be stored: what type of databases. Databases may become an infrastructure commodity because AI will allow us to work directly with knowledge relieving us of the pain of discerning the correct kind of database needed. Cloud computing will provide the level of processing necessary to scale knowledge bases quasi infinitely.“Unfortunately, we are seeing other examples where open source maintainers are muddying the waters between the open source community and the proprietary code they create to monetize the open source”, says @Adrian Cockcroft of # AWS in one of his blogs.The current strategy of some entrepreneurs of using successful open source projects as a Trojan horse to raise venture capital and then transform them into a “muddied,” so-called “enterprise edition,” is a betrayal of open source principles. This “business plan” is a profitable “technique” to create quasi proprietary solutions for gigantic profits for some individuals, by taking advantage of thousands of great developers. In time, the initial open source project becomes inferior while the proprietary solution gets entrenched into customers, generating $100Ms in revenue. Some companies are faithful to open source principles and become successful, though. Maybe the open source community should do something about this deception by excluding from its ranks companies who are using the community as a jump-start toward proprietary solutions. The current open source model is very lucrative for some hundreds of “entrepreneurs” and unfair for millions of software engineers. Currently, open source movement has a bit of a moral crisis. Cloud infrastructure is an essential tool for open source communities to implement a fairer contribution-reward model and invent new business plans, which will benefit materially and morally all developers, not just a few.The cloud can become a gigantic trading place, by ubiquitously making available the processing resources and by implementing platforms based on blockchain (capable of processing securely and accounting for micro-value). In this market, open source developers can trade their code, regardless of its size and complexity by using peer-to-peer transactions. Open source business should get inspiration from the music industry and help individual creators of software value to take advantage of their work.Can cloud computing stop the migration of brains from underdeveloped countries by making available to them the same computing capabilities as in the country they want to emigrate?The Internet has provided access but not the means to make a living in many developing countries. Can a young Indian programmer work for Google in his village in India and generate high income, helping his country to evolve faster? Can a young kid in Central America study via the Internet in his town? Can he, after graduation, be later employed there by a company from South Africa to program robots for extracting the magic metal from goldmines?And we need to talk about climate change. How many video adds are we forced to see without our consent? Every single one generates indirectly significant CO2, worse than cars running on gas! We are chasing the speed and performance of applications, but what about efficiency? The principle of least privilege allows cloud applications to run more securely with minimum restrictions. We should extrapolate this concept to the principle of least energy consumption to run high-performance applications with minimum use of energy. We learn in college that “optimization is the last step in software design”. Well, this may not be correct anymore. We have to design cloud software and infrastructure with optimization built-in from the beginning; we have to run services with optimization in mind, every millisecond!Internet, cloud, and data centers are a significant negative contributor to climate change! The processing capacity of the cloud is essential to build systems generating energy with controlled thermonuclear fusion. Some exciting startups have been funded to tackle this crucial goal and help humankind create an infinite amount of clean energy at a low cost. Solar and wind energies are redefining the future of the distributed generation of electrical power. Controlled thermonuclear fusion will put the last nail into the coffin of coal usage and will become the primary centralized source of energy for data centers and clouds. We have to be smart enough to not stop it from happening based on the following prejudice: the presence of the word nuclear in its definition. By inertia, we often make the connotation between the words nuclear and bomb automatically. However, atomic physics was essential for cloud computing: electronics, integrated circuits, computers, the software would not have existed without it. “Nuclear” is a profound and transformational term.Originally published at https://www.linkedin.com.----Nelu is a computer scientist, technology visionary (as several venture capitalists describe him), Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and high tech executiveNelu Mihai--Nelu Mihai--Nelu Mihai--Nelu Mihai--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alex Mathers--228HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Nelu Mihai,https://medium.com/@nelu,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*AQkLy1yZ9c-9sp998Dcy7A.jpeg",18,3

If you were really against capitalism, you’d live like an off-the-grid caveman instead of participating in the capitalist system.” The spirit of this argument has prevailed among critics who speculate about the allegedly expensive tastes of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one among a recent wave of democratic socialists to hold political office.As a case in point, consider how she was ridiculed by one Fox News reader for making the modest suggestion that profit shouldn’t be prioritized at the expense of human lives and the planet:Never mind that AOC worked as a bartender prior to her election to Congress, and has disclosed that she is struggling, like many other D.C. residents, to afford the cost of rent in the city. Let us assume that this reader’s questionable claims about her lifestyle are true: would that make her — or any other self-proclaimed socialist who pays for a nice phone, car or apartment — a hypocrite?There’s no doubt that the cumulative effect of individuals’ choices about how to spend their money can have a tangible and significant impact on conditions of production. Our smartphones wouldn’t continue being produced, for instance, by the exploited labor of factory workers in poor countries if there weren’t any demand for them. However, the scope of our freedom to avoid fueling that demand, and whether it can be articulated alongside demands for global progress in workers’ rights, are perhaps the real questions at stake here.Many pro-capitalists like to perpetuate the myth that consumer choices tend to be voluntary and informed in a free market economy. For one, this perspective overlooks the role of a multibillion-dollar advertising industry whose primary aim is to convince people to spend money. It accomplishes this aim not by way of objectively informing the public about the benefits and drawbacks of various goods and services, but by promoting a particular good or service through any means possible.It’s easy enough to resist the pressure of this industry by becoming a “conscious consumer,” right? But how easy is it to get by without items that employers expect practically every job-seeker and worker to own today (personal computers, smartphones, and professional attire, to name a few)? In a society where many people’s survival is contingent on whether they’re able to maintain a steady job, one could argue that your smartphone would be more appropriately classed as a necessity than a luxury item. That smartphone is a “gift of capitalism” only insofar as you conceive of someone else’s underpaid labor as a gift, and insofar as you view your decision to own it as fully voluntary. It is possible, on the one hand, to appreciate the social value that smartphones bring us, while on the other hand, arguing that more of the surplus value (i.e., profit) they yield should end up in the hands that produce them.Being a socialist doesn’t mean believing that people shouldn’t be free to make choices about how to spend their income, or that they shouldn’t enjoy any of the comforts that technological advancements have afforded some of us. Many of those advancements, by the way, owe greater thanks to public research funding than to market competition. Being a socialist can mean, instead, precisely the opposite: empowering more individuals with the personal freedom that follows from having housing, food, and healthcare guaranteed as a right.I do not mean to discount valid criticisms of wealthy “socialists” who funnel their wealth primarily toward personally fulfilling aims, while agreeing to chip in for Medicare for all one day, if and when it is actually realized. For many of us, living in alignment with socialist values means recognizing that we have immediate responsibilities to others, and to the world, that cannot wait for the next election cycle. And yes: maybe politicians who wish to take this responsibility seriously should really ditch the private jets.Originally published at https://www.dsausa.org on March 15, 2019.----Brooklyn-based data science and political science graduate, interested in using the power of data for public good. https://www.linkedin.com/in/avonlea-fisher/Avonlea FisherinTowards Data Science--1Avonlea FisherinAnalytics Vidhya--Avonlea FisherinTowards Data Science--Avonlea FisherinTowards Data Science--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423Alex Mathers--228Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--120HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech",Avonlea Fisher,https://medium.com/,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*-aE6cp96gG2X_Y_6.png",4,231

This was the first recorded options contract.Nowadays, bankers use options to speculate on anything from Apple stock to wheat to weather. Derivatives have become an integral part of the global financial system, for both speculation and risk management. In fact derivatives have burgeoned into a $500 trillion dollar market, exceeding global GDP by over 7 times.After the ’08 crisis these financial instruments had their reputation tarnished — and rightfully so — as derivatives such as the CDO³, a three times repackaged collateralized debt obligation, masked enormous risk in the underlying mortgage market. This type of financial engineering added complexity to an already opaque market and created leverage that was difficult to identify in the system.Still, certain derivatives are a necessary component for many businesses.Whether you’re an airline, a tomato farmer, or any business with credit needs there are ways derivatives can be used to manage risk. In these situations an increase in the price of oil, a decrease in the price of tomatoes, or a rise in interest rates can significantly damage your bottom line. Derivatives allow you to lock in the price of a commodity or the interest rate on a loan in order to mitigate that risk. This type of hedging provides tangible benefits to these business owners. However, it wouldn’t be possible without the speculators. Someone always has to take the other side of the bet.Just as gold miners have an inherent long position on gold, bitcoin miners have a similar position to bitcoin. In order to decrease the impacts of a precipitous drop in price, miners can use derivatives to offset some of that risk.This has not been easy for most of bitcoin’s existence.Creating these structured products requires regulatory approval, which as we know has been a hurdle for anything related to bitcoin. The first crypto derivative came about in 2014 after Tera Exchange received CFTC approval to list bitcoin swaps and forwards. Since then there have been a number of exchanges (including the largest derivatives exchange in the world — CME Group) looking to offer bitcoin derivatives.A partial list of the largest crypto derivatives platforms today:These products open the possibility for businesses with long exposure to bitcoin to hedge their risk, even if the biggest use case for crypto options to date has been leveraged bets on the underlying assets.No one knows that better than Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMEX.With the recent uptick in volatility, Bitmex saw daily volumes reach a staggering $10 billion in notional value recently. This coincided with volumes on the CME blowing by prior all time daily highs by 50% to over $1.25 billion in notional.If the crypto markets are anything like the traditional markets, we should expect to see explosive growth in the number and type of derivatives traded. 2019 is already proving to be a major year for crypto derivatives.We’ve already seen Kraken acquire a future’s trading firm for over $100 million, and Bakkt is planning to test their futures trading this July.With the necessary infrastructure in place for institutions, we believe it is likely that derivative volume will soon surpass spot markets as it has in most asset classes. It’s likely that the majority of crypto price discovery already happens on platforms like BitMEX and Bitfinex today.We’re looking to ingest more data on crypto derivatives markets soon in order to better highlight the state of those markets.
